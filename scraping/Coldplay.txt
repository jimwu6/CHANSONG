[Verse 1]
Stuck in a corner
Like monkeys in cages
That don't have a number
And fight one another
Try to recover

[Verse 2]
Climb up a ladder
Look up and you see birds
Blind as each other
How long can we suffer?
We're as blind as each other

[Chorus]
On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer

[Verse 3]
Sisters and brothers
Who fight one another
Will mourn and deceive us
Will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us

[Verse 4]
How soon is now?
Only how long is never?
I'm nothing but normal
We're something together
Come on and stick together

[Chorus]
On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer

[Outro: Simon Pegg]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!


[Verse 1]
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came down
Gets colder day by day, I miss her

[Chorus]
I hear children singin'
It felt like Christmas time

[Verse 2]
In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle

[Chorus]
And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time

[Bridge]
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow
I think of you wherever you go

[Verse 3]
She's gone 2000 miles, it's very far
The snow came falling now
Gets colder day by day, I miss you

[Chorus]
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time
I hear people singin'
It felt like Christmas time

[Verse]
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

[Chorus]
Time is so short
And I'm sure
There must be something more

[Verse]
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head, oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

[Chorus]
Time is so short
And I'm sure
There must be something more

[Bridge]
You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven, but you oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head

[Verse 1]
Turn your magic on
Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends, every day
That's what she told him

[Verse 2]
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

[Chorus]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Post-Chorus]
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Verse 2]
Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

[Chorus]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Post-Chorus]
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Bridge]
Turn your magic on, Umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape
(Woo, woo)

[Refrain]
If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh then I
And if we've only got this life
You'll get me through
And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh then I
Want to share it with you
With you, with you
Yeah, I do

[Outro]
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)

[Verse]
Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

[Chorus]
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

[Bridge]
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I've just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams


[Intro: Charlie Chaplin]
I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. The kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure!
A wonderful adventure!

[Verse 1]
Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

[Verse 2]
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

[Chorus]
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
You get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I've just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams


[Bridge]
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
Now you've got me open-handed
Now you've got me lost for words
I sing oh, whoa, oh, oh
I sing oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

[Outro]
Full of dreams (Oh, whoa, oh, oh)
Into life, I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

[Ambience]

[Verse]
Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

[Chorus]
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I've just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

[Verse 1]
We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History has some to know
We were moving at the speed of flight

[Pre-Chorus]
Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

[Chorus]
Just an alien

[Verse 2]
We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

[Pre-Chorus]
Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

[Chorus]
Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

[Bridge]
Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home

[Chorus]
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
For a lifetime
Just an alien
Moving target
Target movement
Oh, we just want to get home again
A patch, a corner
Of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien


[Verse 1]
We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio

[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Fish fell out of water
Bird stuck on the ground
Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
The whole world on a flight path
I wonder where they'll go, ah
Trouble's on the outside, I know

[Chorus]
But now, all I can think about is you
All I can think about is you
If all that I'm on earth to do
Is solo, then what a lone poor shoe
I want to walk in a two

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
Go!
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do


[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Everything is falling all around you
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only
Thing left that's true

On and on
You're told which side you're on
You're forced you're thrown
To become the scythe to cut the corn
And all your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they go
All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're thrown
Into the fire

Ten below
Call comes in on the radio
Over you go
And red now, all the rivers flow
The poppies grow

All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're blown
All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Ride into the sunset
And they're taken home
Open fire
Open fire


Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Just ride and fire

[Introduction]

I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do
But I don't forget

My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try
My heart stays still

It never moves
Just won't be led
So my mouth waters to be fed
And you're always in my head

You're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my
Always in my

This, I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen out
From the rest

[Verse 1]
I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do, but I don't forget
My body moves, goes where I will
But though I try, my heart stays still
It never moves, just won't be led
And so my mouth waters to be fed

[Chorus]
And you're always in my head
Always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head, ayy
You're always in my head
Oh no, you're always in my
Always in my

[Outro]
This, I guess
Is to tell you you're chosen out from the rest

[Verse 1]
We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"

[Chorus]
And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and its weight"
And here I just wanna stay
Amazing day, amazing day

[Verse 2]
We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place where you can be who you are

[Chorus]
And the view; the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms, I just wanna sway
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh


[Bridge]
And I asked
Can the birds in poetry chime?
"Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?"
Oh thanks God, must've heard when I prayed
Cause now I always want to feel this way

[Outro]
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today

[Verse 1]
My song is love
Love to the loveless shown
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone

[Verse 2]
Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you, clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

[Hook]
And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
Can I get that message home?

[Verse 3]
My song is love
My song is love unknown
But I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own


[Hook]
And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

[Bridge]
And I'm not gonna stand and wait
I'm not gonna leave it until it's much too late
On a platform, I'm gonna stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

[Outro]
My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home

[Verse 1]
My song is love
My song is love, unknown
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone
My heavy heart
Looks like it's made of stone
But it's so hard to see, clearly
You don't have to be on your own [x2]

[Chorus]
And I'm not going to take it back
Oh I'm not going to say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm not singing on my own

[Verse 2]
That bitter breathe
That bitter breathe has blown
Left me on fire, for you, clearly
Taken everything and gone
It's taken everything I own

[Chorus]
But I'm not going to take it back
I'm not going to say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

[Verse 3]
I'm not going to stand and wait
Not going to leave it until it's much too late
On a platform I'm going to stand and say
Oh I'm nothing on my own
Till that bitter breathe has blown
My song is love, Is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home

[Verse 1]
Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

[Verse 2]
Come here, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

[Chorus]
But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

[Verse 3]
Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

[Chorus]
And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

[Outro]
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose
And you came along and you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose
You came along
And you cut me loose


[Verse 1]
Animals we are
Disposable, collapsible and raw
In you go into some crowded room
And animals that climb
And they're climbing over you until you say
"Off you go, off you go"

Animal I am
And I'm looking for an answer just like you
But I should know which way to turn

An animal that runs
And I ran away from you because I'm scared
"Now off you go, off you go"

[Chorus]
If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
So if you're gonna go
Go now

[Verse 2]
Animal you are
Disposable defenceless yes and
Watch your mouth, boys watch your mouth
An animal that runs
And I made all my excuses to you
And I missed my chance by a stones throw


[Chorus]
If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
So if you're gonna go
Go now

[Bridge]
Go now
Go now
Go now

[Outro]
And I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal

Yes I crumble
Crumble and fall
Crumble and fall like an animal



[Verse 1]
Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Used to be your arms around me
Your body on my body

[Chorus]
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms, another's arms
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms, another's arms

[Verse 2]
Late night watching TV
Used to be you here beside me
Is there someone there to reach me?
Someone there to find me?

[Chorus]
When the pain just rips right through me
Another's arms, another's arms
And that's just torture to me
Another's arms, another's arms
Pull yourself into me
Another's arms, another's arms
When the world means nothing to me
Another's arms, another's arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Got to pull you close into me
Another's arms, another's arms
Pull yourself right through me
Another's arms, another's arms

[Outro]
Late night watching TV
Wish that you were here beside me
Wish that your arms were around me
Your body on my body


[Verse 1]
Been around the world, the wonders to view
Been around the world, looking for someone like you
Pyramids try, Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

[Chorus]
So I never say die, aim never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

[Verse 2]
Been around the world, universe too
I've been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you
Right when the storm comes through

[Chorus]
Cause I never say die, aim never untrue
Never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah

[Bridge]
Cause you reign
All cause you reign
All cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through

[Outro]
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
It's my only weapon, army of one
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one


[Verse 1]
He said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground
He said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me, baby, in the crumbling walls

Oh, I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
And do back the things it did to you in return

Oo-oh, Oo-oh
Oo-oh, Oo-oh

Said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh, and I'm gonna buy this place that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

[Hook]
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on


[Verse 2]
He said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me, baby, watch the orange glow
Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why

So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, that's what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head
Oh, to the head, oh

[Hook]
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on
As you mean to go on

[Outro]
So meet me by the bridge
Oh, meet me by the lane
When am I going to see
That pretty face again


Meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head

[Verse 1]
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

[Chorus]
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart, oh

[Chorus]
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I think I see you ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh)

[Verse 1]
As far as I can see
All time and circuitry is wrong

As far as poetry
Sit down and sing to me a song

[Chorus]
'Cause all I want in this world
All I want in this world
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell
A spell

[Verse 2]
Soldier come home to me
You've been away from me so long

[Chorus]
And all I want in this world
All I want and deserve
Is for you to come home

[Outro x 2]
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell

Oh, oh oh oh


[Verse 1]
Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some heard the gun
Some bent the bow
Sometimes the wire must tense for the note
Caught in the fire, say "oh"
We're about to explode

[Chorus]
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world

[Verse 2]
Some far away
Some search for gold
Some dragon to slay
Heaven we hope is just up the road
Show me the way, Lord
'Cause I, I'm about to explode

[Chorus]
Carry your world
I'll carry your world
Carry your world
I'll carry your world


[Outro]
Carry your world, and all your hurt
(Carry your world)

[Hook]
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
I hear a sound
The ticking of clocks
I remember your face
Who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound
The ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

[Bridge]
Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forward or backwards
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers

[Hook]
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
I hear a sound
The ticking of clocks
I remember your face
Remember to see when you are lost
I hear the sound
The ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me
When I am lost
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

This was our first chapter
From now on we'll only be full of surprises
We love you
We're grateful for all of you, with all of our hearts
We exist for and because of you
Goodnight, good afternoon, good morning wherever you are in the world
God bless you all
Be kind to each other
We're in this together
We're one big band
Everything is possible, if you never give up
And if you Believe in Love

Nobody said it was easy.
No one ever said it would be so hard.
I'm going back to the start.

[Verse 1]
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less

[Verse 2]
I wanna be bigger, stronger, drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And drive around a faster car
I will settle for nothing less

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
(you know what you did
(She says he is my son
Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
(Don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover


[Verse 1]
Been standing in the corner, studying the lights
The dreaming of escape will keep you up at night
But someone had put the flares up and got me in the rays
So I guess I'd better stay
'Uh uh no come on' you say

[Refrain 1]
It's a fools gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start 'What if
I won't see you again'
Around here you never want to sleep all night
So start falling in love, start the riot and

[Chorus 1]
Come on rage with me
We don't need words
And we'll be birds
Got to make our own key

[Verse 2]
Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing, but geography


[Refrain 2]
Come on and raise it
Come on and raise this noise for the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on it's not over if you mean it, say loud
Come on all for love, out from the underground

[Chorus 2]
Away with me
We don't need words
Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds, flying free
Holding on in the mystery
Fearless, fearless, fearless

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Fearless together
You said 'we'll go through this together'

[Outro]
When you fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you're so cool

Chris Martin :
This is probably the best song ever written And he's the best singer in the world, Mr. Richard Ashcroft. Ok, here we go:
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Tryin' to make ends meet
You're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah
You know I can't change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down?
Well I never pray
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds
That recognize the pain in me, now
I let the melody shine
Let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now
You know i can't change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down?
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Tryin' to make ends meet
You're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet yeah
You know i can't change, I can change
I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold
I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people
From one day to the next
I can't change my mold
No, no, no, no, no
Have you ever been down?, have you ever been down?
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
Ever been down
Have you ever been down?, Ooh
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah
My life
Your life
Their lives
Come take it down the only road I've ever been down
'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, yeah
This life, this life, this life...
Thank you . . 



An' people wanna fight for fun
But what is a battle when the war's already been won
People wanna break what's built
There's no use crying when the milk's already been spilt

Here's a needle, here's a thread
Sew yourself up, clear your head
Here's a needle, here's a thread
Oh no, I meant exactly what I said

You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground
You might find that you're useless
No better than a hole in the ground

Well, look at all the cavemen going
Turning over to the shore
Ohhh

Gonna want to run around
With someone who will let you down
Ohhh

I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution


Come on now, don't you want to see
This thing that's happening to me?
Like moses has power over sea
So you've got a power over me
Come on now, don't you want to know?
You're a refuge, somewhere I can go
And you're air that, air that I can breathe
You're my golden opportunity
And oh, oh yes, I would
If I only could
And you know I would
Now baby, I, oh baby, I, I wish
Come on now, don't you want to see
Just what a difference you've made in me
And I'll be waiting no matter what you say
And I'll keep waiting for days and days, and days
And oh, oh yes, I would
If I only could
And you know I would
Now baby I, oh baby, I wish
I wish, I wish
If the sky's gonna fall down, let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down, you can break on me
If the sky gonna fall down, let it fall on me
Oh Lord, let it fall on me

[Verse 1]
When you're sitting on a beach in a car with the paint dried up
Well, you're going to give a cause when the rain washed up
Well being just there with the gypsy talking to my friend
But you'll never get with it if you don't get respect
Oh well you'll never get with it if you just want respect

[Chorus]
But sometimes the money's going to run out
And you'll be standing on the corner with a belly full of doubt
Sometimes somebody's going to bring you down
And you'll be standing on your own with a bucket for a crown

[Verse 2]
Well me and the boys were standing thinking we were hip
I don't wanna be the captain of a sinking ship
Well me and the boys in a town where the Mormon go
Listening to a session by Noel Gallagher
I was listening to a session by Noel Gallagher

[Chorus]
They said sometimes your money's going to run out
And you'll be standing on a corner with a belly full of doubt
Oh someday somebody's going to bring you down
And you'll be standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown
Oh you'll be standing on a corner, just waiting on a corner
Standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown

[Verse 1]
At night they would go walking
'Til the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets they go searching
To see God in their own way
Save the night time for your weeping
Your weeping

[Chorus]
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay

[Verse 2]
So we rode down to the river
Where Victorian ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken
We go wander 'neath the arches
Where the witches are and they say
"There are ghost towns in the ocean"
The ocean

[Chorus]
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay

[Verse 3]
God is in the houses
And God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden
But I don't know what he said
For my heart it wasn't open
Not open

[Chorus]
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
There's no light over London today


[Intro: 'Otuto Nke Chukwu']

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died at every duel
This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still the sign upon my headstone, write
"A champion of the world"

[Interlude]
Oh oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best at taking flight
But my rocket ship reversed
Oh, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
But I'll stand before conquistadors
Till I'm champion of the world


[Chorus: Chris Martin, Chris & Will]
(When I sail) And when I sail
I'm sailing west
(Know I might fail) Knowing I might fail
But still I'm hoping for the best
(In my dreams) And in my dreams
Onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say
"I wandered the whole wide world but
Baby, you're the best"

[Interlude: Chris Martin]
Lo lo-lo-lo lo oh
Ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yeah
Lo lo-lo-lo lo

So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I am jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe
I have E.T. on my bicycle
Because giving up won't work
Now I'm riding on my rocketship
And I'm champion of the world

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died in every duel
This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still the sign upon my headstone, write
"A champion of the world"

[Interlude]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best to stay in fight
But my rocket ship won't work
No, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
Still I'll stand before conquistadors
Till I'm champion of the world

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And when I sail, I'm sailing west
Knowing I might fail, but still I'm hoping for the best
In in my dreams, onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say:
"I wandered the whole wide world but
Baby, you're the best"


[Interlude: Chris Martin]
Lo lo-lo-lo lo oh
Ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yeah
Lo lo-lo-lo lo

[Outro: Chris Martin]
So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I'm jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe
I have E.T. on my bicycle
Because giving up won't work
Now I'm riding on my rocketship
And I'm champion of the world
Doo-doo-roo, doo-doo-doo-roo
Doo-roo, doo-roo, doo-roo

[Intro]
Oooo, wooo

[Verse 1]
Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

[Hook]
Oooo-ooo-ooo

[Verse 2]
In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

[Hook]
Oooo-ooo-ooo
We'll be glowing in the dark
A-woo,-a-wooooo


[Bridge]
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark

[Hook]
Oooo-ooo-ooo

[Outro]
So we'll soar
Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark

We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire a fire a spark
Light a fire a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs all the lows, as the room a-spinning goes
We'll run wild, we'll be glowing in the dark


We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark
In the dark



Stole a key
And took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose, come burst in the concrete
Be a cartoon heart

Light a fire, fire the spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart, we'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows as the room is spinning
We'll run riot, we'll be glowing in the dark

So, so, reminiscing wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

[Verse 1]
Fall asleep

Sleep and you'll be satisfied
Sleep and you'll be satisfied
Fall asleep

[Verse 2]
Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Sleep and you'll be crucified
Sleep and you'll be crucified
Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Sleep and you'll be satisfied
Sleep and you'll be satisfied

Sleep
Sleep
Sleep and you'll be
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep and you'll be satisfied
Sleep and you'll be satisfied


[Verse 1]
Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all


[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Chorus]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oh, Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights, keep shining on

Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone

[Verse 1]
Well have you ever stopped to wonder how they do Christmas there down under?
How do they make Christmas nice, when they ain't got no snow  and ice?
And what about poor Santa's sleigh?
He has to come from fucking miles away
And what about Mick Dundee?
Well he ain't got no Christmas tree

[Chorus]
Well they say, Christmas here is so much fun
We got surfing, we got sun
Christmas here's sweet as a peach
Opening presents on the beach
We got barbies, we got beer
Santa wishes he lived here
Loads of laughter, loads of booze
Christmas with the kangaroos

[Verse 2]
Well have you ever stopped to wonder how they do Christmas there down under?
Have you ever stopped to think "Do they have much pumpkin drink?"
Oh don't you just find it shocking?
Have you got Tim Tams in your stocking?
Do you wonder where Jesus was born?
No, they got Kylie, they got Shane Warne


[Chorus]
They all say Christmas here is so much fun
We got surfing, we got sun
Christmas here's sweet as a peach
Opening presents on the beach
Yeah 'cause got barbies, we got beer
Santa wishes he lived here
Loads of laughter, loads of booze
Christmas with the kangaroos

Loads of laughter, loads of booze
That's Christmas with the kangaroos



[Verse 1]
What can I tell you?
When I'm with you, I'm walking on air
Watching you sleeping there, yeah
And what can't I get through?
When for everyone, everywhere
You're answering every prayer

[Chorus]
And when you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're setting your sail
Oh, can I be your seventh sea?
When you're riding a wave
Oh, when you're riding a wave

[Bridge]
'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church
'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
When you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're riding a wave

[Outro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I worship in your church, baby, always
I worship in your church, all the seven days (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I praise and praise
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)


[Verse 1]
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead
Singin', come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'

[Chorus]
You are
You are

[Verse 2]
Confusion never stops
Closing walls and tickin' clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin', come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

[Chorus]
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are


[Bridge]
And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

Lights go out, and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singin'

Come out if things aren't said
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
Tigers waitin' to be tamed, singin'

You are, you are
You are, you are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know, singin'

Come out upon my seas

Am I a part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singin'

[Verse 1]
Lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, and I beg, I beg and plead, singing
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

[Chorus]
You are
You are

[Verse 2]
Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and ticking clocks
Are gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that, but you now know
So I come out upon the seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

Home, home

Tides that I tried to swim against
You've put me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing
You are

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home

Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing

Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)

Could you lend me a hand
Because I've only got one
I miss my fingers
Like you miss your son
Are you thinking about Joffrey?
Such a spirited lad
I was his uncle
I was also his dad
Around the world
My heart had to roam
Now I'm looking for something
A little closer to home
Closer to home
Closer to home
A family tree
With a branch of our own
Closer to home
Closer to home
Ensuring our family
Stays on the throne

[Poem]
Because each
Has been sent
As a guide

[Spoken]
This being human is a guest house
Every morning, a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows
Who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture
Still, treat each guest honorably
He may be clearing you out for some new delight
The dark thought, the shame, the malice
Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide from beyond



[Hook - Coldplay]
Trying hard to speak and
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
It's all part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Anyway you can

[Verse 1]
I grew aware of my motivation
I found my own destination
I was growing up, losing family too
This happens to everyone, nothing new
But when I get a Grammy, no recognition
But when I'm gone, my keys in the ignition
I won't look back on fonder days
Those people hope I ponder my ways
God tells me to forgive, but I can't
My pride tells me to forget, I'm the man
In charge of my glory, don't need approval
Pay homage to a young blood, tribunal
And by God, a man scorned by time
Only does great or leads a life of crime
Keep your eyes on your bread, don't mind
The howls of the beasts who trail behind
Can't follow orders, I remain leading
Sacrifice myself to a greatness that I'm bleeding

[Hook - Coldplay]

[Verse 2]
Haven't seen you since I was a kid
Growing up, I loved you and I thought you did
But now, years passed, and you ain't ish
I tried to refrain from using language
But my mind is saying eff you, go to Hell
If you come back when I'm famous, hope all is well
Tell me that you loved me, but I could never tell
With the way that you and all the others fell
And the only one I ever see is my uncle and my granny
Believe that I won't ever mention you when I get a Grammy
And that man I barely know better recognize that I'm Death
I'm deadlier than deadly, he won't ever fathom the depth
I've been writing in darkness, spitting rhymes in the darkness
Watching pain form in the heart and over coming the hardest
But know, that a child won't ever understand a family torn
This was the bull that happened long before I was even born

[Hook - Coldplay]

[Outro]
You should have known that I would snap
You should have known that I would rage
You tell me that you love me and leave one day?
You tell me that I could do great things, you say?
I'm damn great and I hope you realize
That losing you is my greatest pain
I'm just saying, this what happens when you have a conflicted mind
When you fall into this pit of darkness you don't even understand
Where you have to see counselors and shrinks
I don't think you can comprehend
You never had to fight a day in your life with that, now did you?
No...




[Verse 1]
It could be worse
I could be alone
I could be locked in here on my own
Or like a stone that suddenly drops
It never stops, no

[Verse 2]
I could be lost
Or I could be saved
Calling out from beneath the waves
Beaten down by this ocean rain
Never again
Never again

[Chorus]
Screaming out from the crests of waves

[Verse 3]
It could be worse
Bitter or sweet
It could be snapped from the jaws of defeat
Or like a light lit up on a beach
Wear your heart on your sleeve

[Verse 4]
You want to stop before you begin
You want to sink when you know you could swim
You want to stop just before you begin
Never give in
Never give in

[Chorus]
Screaming out from the crests of waves

[Bridge]
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Nothing matters
Except life and the love you make
Except life and the love you make

[Chorus]
Screaming out from the crests of waves

[Outro]
Screaming out from the crests of waves
You're longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves
You are longing to be saved
Screaming out from the crests of waves

[Verse 1]
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?
Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you wanna say?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know
You're hurting too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I want to say

[Chorus]
You're so far away
Oh, you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
I'm okay

Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you okay?
Look, Dad, we got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I wanna say

Is you're so far away
Oh, and you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
It's okay

Won't you come and won't you stay?
Please stay, oh, please stay
Won't you come and won't you stay?
One day, just one day

[Verse 1]
To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight

[Hook]
Ooh, and the sun will shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Ooh, and I realize
Who cannot live without
Who come apart without
It

[Verse 2]
On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
On a full day, and a full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

[Hook]
Ooh, and the sun will shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Ooh, and I realize
Who cannot live without
Who come apart without


[Outro]
Daylight

Slowly breaking through the daylight [22x]



[Verse]
All winter, we got carried
Away over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer, we just hurried
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry

[Chorus]
No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends

No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends




[Intro: Andy Mineo]
Death of me, death of me, death of me
Death of me, death of me, death of me
This could be the death of me
Death of me, death of me
Me, me, me, me

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, pocket full of boarding passes
I don't know what city I was in last
But I'm out here tryna make a impact
Same time keep myself intact
They say, "Take it, take it easy A like it's gym class"
Tell me how I could?
There's slaves in the world, before I die, tryna see us end that
So I move fast, Ramadan
Move fast, Autobahn
Who cares if I ever get a Grammy nom
If my soul take L's, phenomenon
Still can't believe I get paid for this
As a kid, all I did was pray for this
Now I'm livin' out my dream, craziest
Got me really feelin' like I was made for this
At the same time never knew how dangerous
It could be when lives start getting changed to this
When somebody say you they favourite
Guess it carry some weight to it
You know, 'cause uh
That's power and that's influence
The temptation is to use it for myself and serve somebody else
I'm sittin' here buggin' just rememberin' what them rappers showed me
How to bag a honey, stack the money
They said I was a mac by the number of shorties that I could smash
Now I'm waitin' on that matrimony
Cause I've been changed up
Lil' homie came up
It's depressin', kickin' it with dudes I used to look up to
They still on that same stuff, what!?

[Refrain: Andy Mineo]
I ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one
I bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund

[Hook: Andy Mineo & (Chris Martin)]
I feel like it's the real me, feel me?
Yeah, I been changed, but I'm still me
What I am now, not what I will be
I'm tryna give life
But this could be the death of me
(Para, para, paradise)
The death of me
(Para, para, paradise)
This could be the death of me
(Para, para, paradise)
Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Para, para, paradise)
The death of me
This could be the death of me
(Oh whoa, oh whoa)
Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Para, para, paradise)
Look, death of me
This could be the death of me
(Para, para, paradise)
Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Para, para, paradise)
Death of me
This could be the death of me
(Para, para, paradise)
Just trying to give life, what I do for a living could kill me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Look, mama feel like she losin' me
To this lifestyle that's consumin' me
I travel every weekend even when I'm weak man
You know what that to do to me?
Back pain, back pain
Sleepin' on planes, I'm feelin' like Bruce Wayne
Blackout at night on that stage
Man I need a batcave just to get away
Jesus retreated, woo!
To speak with his Father, I know that I need it
My career been growin'
But tell me where I'm goin' if my time with God is depleted
God I'm sorry, I mean it
All I want to do is walk with you, but
My priorities wrong, I talk about you more than I talk with you
One of my mentors taught me whenever things get foggy
If you wanna grow in God it's not complicated it's just costly
Gotta spend that time, currency
Overtime guess I learned to be
Strong enough to admit I'm weak
To meet with God all I need is me
2014 'bout to be different
I think my favorite word'll be no
Opportunities come and they go
But none of them is worth my soul
That's somethin' that you can't afford
And got me thinkin' what's most important
I get kicks, watchin' grown men in line for some Jordans
Nowadays time is fortune
But chasin' fortune is all consumin'
I feel like God's callin' dudes
They just wanna play Call of Duty (gun shots)
This that Peter Pan, at the dinner table out in Never Land
Eatin', can't nobody see it but me and my boys
That's the way I wanna keep it
I lost a couple friends to this new season
Jealousy and hate for a few reasons
Used to be down, now what's up?
Guess everybody around when the fun's up, yup
Got me feelin' isolated (yeah)
Women wanna holla, I just tell em' that I'm taken (yeah)
Even if I wasn't I'd be slow for the taking
I'll know if they love me or the money I'm making (I don't know)
Ain't no way to really tell
Where somebody heart truly at
Bad girls comin' at me looking good
Showin' off they body that's a booby trap
Beard low, but I never let my guard down
Buddy, I ain't crazy
You ain't bout' to catch me slippin'
Pull a Million Dollar Baby!
Me and Dre trying to eat good
Cuttin' out the nonsense
On the road trying to give life
But I might lose mine in the process

[Refrain: Andy Mineo]
I ain't have no role models, now I gotta be one
I bought the lie hip-hop sold me, man I want a refund
I feel like
Fund, I feel like
Fund, I feel like
Fund, I feel like
Fund, I feel like
Fund, I feel like
Fund, I feel like

[Hook: Andy Mineo & (Chris Martin)]

[Verse 1]
If sweet death should ever conquer me
Let me know boys, let me know
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee?
Let me go boys, let me go

[Verse 2]
One day death is going to conquer me
I'll be down where the waters flow
I hope sweet heaven has a place for me
Let me know boys, let me know

[Verse 3]
If sweet death should ever conquer me
Take me down to some place below
If you hear him coming, won't you set me free?
Let me go boys, let me go

[Outro]
If you hear him coming, won't you sing for me?
That I just don't want to go

[Intro]
Oooh Oooh oooh Oooh

[Verse 1]
So we left La Mancha
Heading out for higher plains
Me and Sancho Panza
Looking for adventure
Rocinante at the reigns
Until the windmills answer

[Chorus]
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely ever again
You'll never be lonely
You'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

[Verse 2]
So they sent the doctor
For examining my brain
Said he's not too clever
When the world, when the world just seems
A little bit too cruel
Going to leave it better
Going to make one better, yeah!


[Chorus]
So tell that princess
Tell that princess "hide down the drain"
Tell that princess she'll never be lonely again
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain

[Verse 3]
Oooh Oooh
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain
Where the people sing
"Ole ole ole ole ole ole"
"Ole ole ole ole, Coldplay Coldplay)"
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain [x2]

[Verse 1]
And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call

[Chorus 1]
When you're tired of racing and you
Found you never left the start
Come on, baby, don't let it break your heart

[Verse 2]
Though heavily we bled
Still, on we crawl
Trying to catch a cannonball
And a slow burning tide
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck, I heard her call
And she sang

[Chorus 2]
When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still, you never hit the mark, oh-oh
And even in your rains and shadows
Still, we're never gonna part, oh-oh
Come on, baby, don't let it break your heart


[Hook]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart

[Outro]
Don't let it break your heart

[Verse 1]
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
They slowly fade away

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

[Verse 2]
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock'n'roll band
Who'll throw it all away


[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

[Chorus]
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

[Chorus]
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say

So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
Don't look back in anger
I heard you say

At least not today

[Intro]
Ah-hmm

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome him, fights, corrugate cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrims going nowhere in millions of cars

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Lagos a dream in the distance
From promises he'd made behind
Where there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep
And beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

[Bridge]
Yeah
Ah-hmm
Ah-hmm

[Chorus: Chris Martin and Tiwa Savage, Chris Martin]
In Africa
We dance in the water and hold
Each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, "It's alright, child
It's alright"

[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
Joseph rode in on a beam of light
And dreamed of his queen by his side
There'll be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride


[Verse 1]
And there's nowhere I'd rather be (Rather be)
When they take with the one hand and take with the other
On the day all the hands go free (Hands go free)
And the sun's gonna shine
The sun's gonna shine on me

[Chorus]
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo

[Verse 2]
Mama Maria, she would take my hand (Take my hand)
Down to el Rio Sol (Ooh)
Saying, "Oye for real hijo understand" (Understand)
"Hands can hurt or heal so"

[Chorus]
Tell all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Free hands go


[Verse 3]
Mama Maria, she would take my hand
Down to the Rio and flow
Baxabana ogxam baxabana ngenoxoxo
Bexakwe yinuxba xaka

[Chorus]
Tell all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
All the people go

Tell all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Free hands go

[Bridge]
And there's nowhere I'd rather be (Rather be)
Gonna raise up the one hand and raise up the other
Hurt me outside, inside I'm free (Inside I'm free)
And there's no enemy
Everyone is my brother
When the truth comes to set me free (Set me free, yeah)
And we're not going to fall in and out with each other
On the day all the hands go free (Hands go free)
Then the sun's gonna shine
And the sun's gonna shine on me


[Chorus]
Tell all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Free hands go

[Outro]
And the sun's gonna shine on me
And I know, one day I know
The sun's gonna shine on me
Let my hands go free
Let my hands go free
Let my hands go free
The sun's gonna shine on me
Let my hands go free
And all hands go free
When all hands go free
The sun's gonna shine on me

[Verse 1]
Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

[Verse 2]
Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don't slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should, but I can't let you go

[Chorus 1]
But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feeling within me, everglow

[Verse 3]
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night, we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, I'm gonna miss you, I know


[Chorus 2]
But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow

[Bridge]
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

[Outro]
So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

[Verse 1]
Oh, they say people come, say people go
These particular diamonds were extra special
And though you might be gone, the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial
And I should, but I can't let you go

[Chorus 1]
But when I'm cold, cold
Yeah, when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feeling within me of everglow

[Verse 3]
Like brothers in blood, or sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night, we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, I'm gonna miss you, I know

[Chorus 2]
But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
I know you're always with me and the way you will show
You're with me wherever I go
But you give me this feeling, this everglow


[Bridge]
What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

[Outro]
So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you give me will everglow

[Spoken-Word Outro: Muhammad Ali]
God is watching me
God is, God don't praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don't give nothin' 'bout Joe Frazier
God don't care nothing about England or America as far as real wealth, it's all His
He wants to know how do we treat each other?
How do we help each other?
So, I'm going to dedicate my life to using my name and popularity to helping charities, helping people, uniting people, bring...
People bombing each other because of religious beliefs
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace
So when I die, if there's a Heaven, I wanna see it

When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on

Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes

Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (Hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on

Everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts
Don't throw your hand, oh no

Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone

If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much of this life to hang on

Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes
And everybody hurts sometimes

So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts


[Verse 1]
What in the world are we going to do?
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind of world do you want it to be?
Am I the future or the history?

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls, everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out

[Verse 2]
How in the world am I going to see
You as my brother, not my enemy?

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves, everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life

[Outro]
At first light, throw my arms out, open wide
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah
Yes



Album Booklet




[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

[Chorus]
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

[Outro]
Oh, it was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
A wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall


[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony

[Chorus]
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh


[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony

[Chorus]
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

[Outro]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids, all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall, is a waterfall


[Chorus]
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh

[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag

[Chorus]
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, ooh



[Intro]
Vamos a cantar juntos
Sing "E-yo" (E-yo)
Sing "E-yo" (E-yo)

[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
But I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning sees another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
Heaven is in sight
Yeah, woo, woo, ooh

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating, pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony
Every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Is a waterfall, ah
Is a waterfall
Every teardrop is a waterfall, ah

[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise
Still, I'll raise the flag

[Outro]
It was a waterfall, a waterfall
Oh, every tear, every tear
Oh, every teardrop is a waterfall
Oh, every tear, every tear
Oh, every teardrop is a waterfall
I said, every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall




[Verse 1]
When I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulders
I drove the other ones away

[Chorus]
So if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

[Verse 2]
When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
And everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

[Chorus]
'Cause if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

If you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

[Outro]
Singing out
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Come on, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Sing out, yeah
And everything's not lost

Now I never meant to do you wrong
That's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong, then I'm sorry
I don't let it stand in our way
Cause my head just aches when I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for living, we all know
And I don't want to live it alone

Sing out,  ah ah
Sing ah ah ah
And just sing ah ah ah ah ah




[instrumental]




[Verse 1]
When I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulders
I drove the other ones away

Sing out, ah ah
Sing ah ah ah
And just sing ah ah ah ah ah


[Verse 1]

[Instrumental]

Help me out, help me out
Cause I'm falling and I can't get back
And there isn't any number I can call for that

Oh, help me out, help me out
Cause I fall, and I was so scared
I know what was severed, and I'm rolling in

Even when the sun set
It burned my eyes
Even when the dark
Began to climb

And just because I roll the dice
And turned to worse
Together for the grace of God
Don't know why

[Verse 1]
When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

[Verse 2]
When the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 3]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Bridge]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Intro]
I'll sing myself to sleep
A song from the darkest hour
Secrets I can't keep
Inside of the day
So sit down
Oh sit down, oh sit down
Sit down next to me
Sit down, down, down, down, down
In sympathy
Oh sit down, oh sit down, oh sit down
Sit down next to me
Sit down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 1]
When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

[Verse 2]
When the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 3]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Bridge]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you




[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
The talk among the skeletons this morning
(Aside from all the medicine and health)
If you could do it all again, would you do it all the same?
Is there something that you'd tell your former self?

There were those that wished they'd spun upon the jukebox
There were pirates who had never seen the sea
But the one recurring theme, the one recurring dream they had
Was to be whatever they wanted to be

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Will Champion]
"To be Pyotr Tchaikovsky
To be free, and like everyone else
There will be no flags to own me, no!
'Cause I just want to be myself"

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Julie, telephoning by a ouija
"Is there any advice that you could give?
When you know you're not like them
Do you know La Varsovienne?
I know that I am living, but can you show me how to live?"

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Will Champion]
And the Holy Roman Army
Said, "Your heart beats like everyone else"
But you don't need no flags to tell you who you are, so say
"I just want to be myself''

[Interlude: Chris Martin]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Will Champion]
There's an aura that surrounds thee
There's a different kind of wealth
And I don't need flags to know you're really something
And I just love you for yourself
Oh, I just love you for yourself

[Outro: Chris Martin]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la


[Verse 1]
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

[Chorus]
And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

[Verse 2]
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following them up

[Chorus]
Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on


[Outro]
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on



[Verse 1]
If you're lost and feel alone
Circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for two
And the way you seem to float
Circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control
With you

[Chorus]
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Everyone of us is hurt
And everyone of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared
Not you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes closed
Your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low

[Chorus]
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Everyone of us is scared
Everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope
All for you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you




[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I know it's over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits for a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oooh-ooh

[Chorus 1: Chris Martin]
From the top of the world, top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin
But, come on, don't give up, don't say we give in
Don't say it's over, don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

[Verse 2: Chris Martin with Tove Lo]
I know it's over before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
"I know it's over," Icarus says to the Sun
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight til it's over, fight til it's done
Ah-ah-ah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin with Tove Lo]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oooh-ooh

[Chorus 2: Chris Martin & Tove Lo]
From the top of the world, top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopped it in its tracks
But nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

[Bridge: Chris Martin with Tove Lo]
'Cause you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be
We were always meant to, always meant to
You and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be

[Bridge: Chris Martin & Tove Lo]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

[Outro: Chris Martin & Tove Lo]
But then, maybe we could again

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you try to hold
Try to hold me near

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptier than anybody knows
Maybe I'm on the ropes
Or I'm not even here
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point in trying to raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear


[Verse 4]
Oh, maybe I'm a ghost
Specter of the wrong curse
A thorn without a rose
Something people fear
Yeah

[Chorus 2]
And every time I thought I walked through walls
It's all becoming clear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point in saying "Rescue me!"
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

[Chorus 3]
And every time I thought I walked through walls
It's all becoming clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear...



[Verse 1]
Scared of losing all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the lines
And he asked
"Will I see heaven in mine?"
That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh, they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Son, don't ask
Neither half full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living
In the past
Going nowhere fast

[Verse 2]
So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Television selling plastic
Figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime, Stars in heaven align
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Son, don't ask
Neither half full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living
In the past
Going nowhere fast

[Outro]
And what are we drinking when we're done?
Glasses of water




Scared of losing all the time
You wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the lines
And he asked, would I see heaven in mine?
That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh and they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?
Oh Oh Oh Oh I
Son, don't ask
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast
So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime
Stars in heaven align
Oh Oh Oh Oh I
Son, don't ask
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast
Oh what are we drinking when we're done?
Glasses of water




[Verse 1]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
I've got to say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

[Verse 2]
Where do we go to draw the line?
I've got to say I wasted all your time, oh, honey, honey
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon your face, yeah

[Chorus]
And ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

[Verse 3]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face, oh yeah

[Chorus]
And ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

[Bridge]
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
Na, na-na, na-na, num-ma-na, na-na
As good as mine
As good as mine (As good as mine)
As good as mine (As good as mine)
As good as mine (As good as mine)

[Outro]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face




[instrumental]


Where do we go nobody knows
I've gotta say I'm on my way, down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line
I've gotta say I wasted all your time, honey, honey
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon your face
Yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I want it to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way, down
When God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
Oh yeah

Now when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah when you work it out I want it to
Now when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine


It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine

Where do we go nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way, down
When God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face

[Verse 1]
Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

That green eyes
Yeah, the spotlight
Shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you

[Chorus]
I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I've met you
And, honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes

[Verse 2]
Honey, you are the sea upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their minds

[Chorus]
Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I've met you
And, honey, you should know that I could never go on without you
Green eyes
Green eyes

[Outro]
Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand


[Verse 1]
Take it from the playgrounds and take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals and squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros, we've been doing all the sums
The judgment of this court is we need more guns

[Refrain]
Stop

[Chorus]
Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

[Verse 2]
Melt down all the trumpets, all the trombones and the drums
Who needs education or A Thousand Splendid Suns?
Poor is good for business, cut the forests, they're so dumb
Only save your look-alikes and fuck the other ones
It's the opinion of this board that we need more guns

[Refrain]
Stop


[Chorus]
Everything's gone so crazy
Everybody but you
Everything's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too



[Verse 1]
She wakes up every morning
Just to do her hair, now
Because she cares, yeah
Her day just wouldn't be right
Without her makeup
Never had her makeup
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she's homeless
As she stands there singing for money

[Chorus]
La-da-dee-la-da-da, la-da-dee-la-da-da
La-da-dee-la-da-da, la-da-doo-la-da-da

[Verse 1]
In my sleep, I see her begging
Preaching, "Please, oh, oh, please"
Although her body isn't mine
I ask, "Oh why, though?
Oh, why, oh, why, though?"
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, but she's homeless
As she stands there singing for money

[Chorus]
La-da-dee-la-da-da-da, la-da-dee-la-da-da-da
La-da-dee-la-da-da-da, la-da-doo-la-da-da-da
Here come in strings now! Let's go!

[Instrumental Break]
Woo!
Woo! Woo!
Breakdown, now

[Breakdown]
And she like you and me, like you and me
She stands there singing for money

[Chorus]
La-da-dee-la-da-da, la-da-dee-la-da-da-da
Sing, la-da-dee-la-da-da, la-da-dee-la-da-da-da
Let's go
Lo-lo-lo-lo, ah-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
La-la-lo-lo-lo-lo, la-la-lo-lo-lo-lo

[Outro]
Let's fade it out, boys
Let's fade it out, boys
Let's fade it out, boys
And we'll fade it out
And do the fade out
This is a fade out
Shhhh...
Annie, you better rescue us we don't know how to end this song
Woo!
We need a DJ, DJ now
We need a DJ now
Woo!
Pfffft, holy moly...

[Verse 1]
If you call and call
Your self esteem is low
And I heard you'd called
Is there no calling?
And away I go
Any way you go
I was on your tail
As clear as crystal

[Chorus]
But it was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through
I know, I

[Verse 2]
Chemicals are cold
See you sit down on
A chemical you cause
Is like a crystal
So I heard you say
I got to get away
I'm on a second trail
As clear as crystal

[Chorus]
But I was harmless
It couldn't hurt you
Oh you were helpless
I know you'll get through

[Verse 1]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be far away

[Verse 3]
And here we are, as In olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us
Once more

[Verse 4]
Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now




[Verse 1]
Stuck here, in the middle of nowhere
With a headache and a heavy heart
Oh well nothing was going quite right here
And I'm tired, I can't play my part

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?
That help is just around the corner for us

[Verse 2]
Oh my head just won't stop achin'
And I'm sat here lickin' my wounds
And I'm shattered but it really doesn't matter
Cos my rescue is gonna be here soon

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?
Help is just around the corner for us
That help is just around the corner for us
Oh that help is just around the corner for us


I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes, just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

[Verse 2]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day

[Break]
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes



[Verse 1]
Can anybody fly this thing?
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring

We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been living life inside a bubble

[Chorus]
Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

[Verse 2]
Can anybody stop this thing?
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring

We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been living life inside a bubble

[Chorus]
Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

[Outro]
In high speed
High speed

High speed you on
High speed you on
High speed you on
High speed you on

[Verse 1]
I am dreaming of when I get back to Houston
I am dreaming of that fair and special place
I am dreaming of when Houston has no problems
In that city where they send you into space

[Chorus]
I am dreaming of when I get back to Texas
Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There's a harmony that hums down there in Houston
Oh, Houston you got to keep on keeping on

[Verse 2]
From Miami we are sending love to Houston
We are praying that you make it through the rain
I know nothing's gonna break the will of Houston
Oh, and we can't wait to go down there again

[Chorus]
I am dreaming of when I get back to Texas
Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There's a harmony that hums down there in Houston
Oh, Houston you got to keep on keeping on

Take it Jon!


[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Oh, Houston got to keep on keeping on
Yeah, Houston got to keep on keeping on

[Verse 1]
Are you missing something?
Looking for something?
Tired of everything?
Searching and struggling?
Are you worried about it?
Do you wanna talk about it?
Oh you're gonna get it right sometime

[Verse 2]
There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
Are you running in a circle?
You can't be too careful
And you can't relate it
'Cause it's complicated
Oh you're gonna get it right sometime
You're gonna get it right sometime

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Oooh


[Verse 3]
Is there something missing?
Is nobody listening?
Are you scared of what you don't know?
Don't wanna end up on your own
You need conversation and information
Oh you're gonna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
But you can't believe a word?
That's how you see the world
Oh don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt you

[Outro]
That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world

[Verse 1]
They put the world in a tin can
Black market contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes

[Verse 2]
There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
Oh, if you hear can you let me know
How can they invade it
Oh, when it's so complicated?
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Oooh


[Verse 3]
Is there's something missing
There's nobody listening
Are you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man-trapped
We don't wanna be shrink-wrapped
Oh, just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
That you can't believe a word
That's how you see the world
Oh, don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt you

[Outro]
That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world

[Verse 1]
They put the world in a tin can
Black market, contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes

[Verse 2]
There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
If you hear can you let me know
How can they invade it
When it's so complicated?
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Oooh


[Verse 3]
When there's something missing
Seems like there's nobody listening
If you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man-trapped
We don't wanna be shrink-wrapped
Oh, just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
That you can't believe a word?
That's how you see the world
Ah, don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt you

[Outro]
That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world



Here, I am
And beyond the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep
And she's sweet another know why
These dreams could've seen her
And I watched her slipping away
And I know I'll be hunting high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too find her again
Upon this my dreams I depend
And, through the dark
I can hear the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find
So I know I'll be hunting high and low
High...
There's no end to the lengths
I'll go too high and low
High...
Do you know how it feels to love you?
Do you know how it feels to love you?
High and Low


[Introduction]

[Verse 1]
Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
"Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?"
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Written up in marker on a factory sign
"I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine"
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
See the arrow they shot trying to tear us apart
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still, I won't let go
Still, I won't let go
Of you
'Cause you do

[Hook]
Oh, you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

[Verse 2]
On every street, every car, every surface, a name
Tonight, the streets are ours
And we're writing and saying
"Don't let 'em take control"
No, we won't let 'em take control
Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
How come they're out to get us?
How come they're out when they don't know the facts?
So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas, I'll go making my mark
Armed with a spraycan soul
I'll be armed with a spraycan soul
And you
Oh, you


[Hook]
'Cause you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Yeah, it's true
When you
Use your heart as a weapon
Then it hurts like heaven
Oh, it hurts like heaven



[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Who you suckers think you trippin' with? Yes I'm the boss
745, white-on-white, that's Rick Ross
I cut 'em wide, I cut 'em long, I cut 'em fat
I keep 'em comin' back, we keep 'em comin' back
I'm into distribution, I'm like Atlantic
I got them pretty things flyin' across the Atlantic
I know Pablo, Noriega
The real Noriega, he owe me a hundred favors
I ain't petty player, we buy the whole thang
See most of my homies hustle, they still do they thang
My roof back (roof back), my money rides (my money ride)
I'm on the pedal, show you what I'm runnin' like
When they snatched Black, I cried for a hundred nights
He got a hundred bodies, servin' a hundred lives

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm

[Verse 2:Plan B]
Yeah I'm always hustlin' blud
I'm hustlin' even when
I'm just sitting in the flat, sipping on a Jack, chilling with my girlfriend
'Cause I'm always on the phone like who? What? When?
What did you just say? Can you say that again?
What you motherfucking mean, motherfucker wants ten?
Motherfucker's supposed to be my motherfucking friend
Give him eight per cent and say that shit's peng
Considering that I'm still living in the ends
And I'm still driving in the same old banged out ride
Reg plate starting with an N
Looking at the Benz
And the BMs
Thinking: how come I ain't in one of them
Yeah my LP dropped blud, so what then?
Them there money's dried up since then
I'm still Ben
Same old little pink dicked white boy that I was before
Except now I'm a little less young
Little less dumb and a little less poor?
What's enough? More? Is it 'cause I think your tough enough or do I just know the score?
Blud, they can't say I ain't talented, all they can say is that I'm too raw
What's my name? Ben Drew, not Ben Draw
Still no-one backs me like Jo
Whiley, Ras Kwame or Zane Lowe
On BBC Radio
Who cares what that fat prick said he's pop
Yeah Chris Moyles - he had a pop
First him and now Tim, So what?
Neither of them got a clue about Hip Hop
Blud

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm


[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Where do we go, nobody knows
I've got to say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

[Chorus]
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Ev-everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm hustlin'
Everyday I'm, everyday I'm

[Verse 1]
Been rusting in the rubble
Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint
Found myself in trouble
Thinking about what ain't
Never gonna be a saint

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Saying float like an eagle
Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh again and again

[Chorus]
Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

[Verse 2]
It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views


[Pre-Chorus 2]
And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again, and again

[Chorus]
How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

[Outro]
Oh again, and again
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift to a permanent high
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
It was dark
Now it's sunrise

[Verse]
Darling, those tired eyes
Go with me all the time
And in the dead of night
Tell me you will be mine
Where do you go to, pretty babe?
Where do you go to when the night wins away?
Ask me so sweetly, what do I do?
And who do I sing for
Well honey I sing about you
You



So I was an idiot
I was a goddamn idiot
Because I came here so violent
Because I came around here so violent
I said yes I was an idiot
I was a goddamn idiot
Because I made you think for it
Because I came round here to think for it

And sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot
Like an idiot

I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot

I was an idiot
I fell down like a goddamn idiot
Because I came here to bring them down
Because I came round here to fight them down
I said yes I felt like an idiot
I was a goddamn idiot

Sing it
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive

My love, my love, where have you been?
My love, my love, where did you go?
My love, my love, what have you seen?
My love, you're such an idiot
Like an idiot

I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off
Like an idiot
Listen now, it's a wonderful life

Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive

Never felt so alive
It's a wonderful life
Never felt so alive
Never felt so alive


So you lost you trust
And you never should have, no you never should have
But don't break your back, if you ever see this
But don't answer that
Chorus--
In a bullet-proof vest, with the windows all closed
I'll been doing my best, i'll see you soon
In a telescope lens, and when all you want's friends
I'll see you soon
So it came for you it came snapping at your heels
It came snapping at your heels
But don't break your back
If you ever say this
But don't answer that
Chorus
I'll see you soon
And oh, you lost your trust
And oh, you lost your trust
No, don't lose your trust
No, you lost your trust

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Living for today
Aha-ahh

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
Yoohoo-ooh

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
Yoohoo-ooh

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

[Ramsay]
If there's one thing Theon might've taught ya
[Theon]
(one thing I've taught ya)
[Ramsay]
Is once I've got ya
[Theon]
(once he's got ya)
[Ramsay]
You will be tortured
[Theon]
(it will be torture!

[Ramsay]
I'm a real bastard
[Theon, Myranda]
(he's a bit of a bastard)
[Ramsay (and Chorus)]
A little more mean (a little more mean) than anyone you've ever seen (than anyone you've ever seen, ever seen)

[Verse 1]
Got a tattoo that said "together thru life"
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up, will it be alright? Ooooh ooh
Feels like there's something broken inside

[Chorus 1]
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

[Verse 2]
Got a tattoo and the pain's alright, oooh oooh
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside (Ooooh ooh)

[Chorus 2]
All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

[Bridge/Outro]
I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colors
And I'm dying of thirst
All I know is that I love you so
So much that it hurts (Oh yeah yeah yeah)
So much that it hurts
So much that it hurts

[Verse 1]
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

[Hook]
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

[Verse 2]
I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah

[Hook]
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

[Bridge]
Sing it please, please, please
Come back, come sing to me
To me, me
Come on and sing it out
Now, now
Come on and sing it out
To me, me
Come back, come sing it

[Outro]
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And though I started here
I ran away from you
I'm going to come on in
And see it through

[Verse 2]
I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And when I heard you call to
Come back to me
And though I should stay
I don't have the stomach to

[Chorus]
Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do
I have your love on call
And yet my belly is so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna come on in
My eyes were closed
I can feel it near
The sides so close
I'm gonna come on out
And burn the sky

[Verse 4]
A star arose in my own cage
I stuck in line
And in a cage
Just a single star
I sing for

[Chorus]
Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool to mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a stupid thing to do
I have your love on call
And yet my belly is so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you

[Outro]




Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringin' a bell

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineer would see him sitting in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Go Johnny Go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

His mother told him, "Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight."

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go Go
Johnny Go
Oh Go go
Johnny Go
Oh Go Go
Johnny Go
Go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse: Coleman Barks]
This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all!
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide

[Outro]


[Verse 1]
From the very start, it
Came apart, it
Broke up into pieces and
There was a chance I could've missed it
It could risked it
But I put myself into your hands

[Chorus]
'Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
Oh, you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun

[Verse 2]
I should've run my courses
For the opposing forces
And all men are just mortals, and
If you want me, you can have me
Take me, oh baby, grab me
'Cause if you want me, then you can have me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun
Oh, you're not just anyone
You're a ladder to the sun


[Bridge]
Oh now boy, what you been and done
You set a course that you couldn't run
Oh now boy, what you been and done

I had it all and I risked it
A chance and I missed it
I had it and I risked it all
And I risked it all

A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the

I had it all and I risked it all

A ladder to the
A ladder to the sun
A ladder to the

[Verse 1]
All summer we hung round'
On the streets of our hometown
Dreamed about us getting close
Dressing in your wedding clothes
All summer it went on
We got Kings of Leon on
Got me in a tripped-out haze
Busy hours turned into days, we were (oh)

[Chorus]
I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
I got drunk and took too much
Love is a lethal drug

[Verse 2]
All summer we belong to the way we let it on
Feeling slowly sinking in, lying back and watching heaven spin
In my head the parrot saw
Biomorphic thick in the stars
I don't know what else to win
Just give me one, give me one more hit (oh)

[Chorus]
I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
Fell down and picked it up
Love is a lethal star
I just can't give you up, but you're coursing through my blood
I just couldn't get enough, love is a lethal drug
Love is a lethal drug

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Just went up in smoke [?]
Are we in love with another dose?
I soar when my body floats
Love in a lethal dose
Love in a lethal dose, yeah
Love in a lethal dose




[Verse 1: Kylie Minogue]
I'm all by myself
I don't need anybody else
I'm all by myself
No help

I'm all on my own
Quietly sleeping in my home
I'm all on my own
My own

[Refrain: Chris Martin]
Hello
Won't you let me come in?
Lhuna
Can't you hear how much I'm suffering?
Hello
Won't you let me know?
Cause I'm all alone
All alone

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kylie Minogue]
We are dreaming
About Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
Dreaming
About Lhuna
Her and me
Simultaneously

[Bridge: Kylie Minogue]
I don't know what the time is
I don't know where you've flown
And I don't know why you're so far
From home

[Refrain: Chris Martin]
Hello
Won't you let me come in?
Lhuna
Can't you hear how much I'm suffering?
Hello
Won't you let me know?
Cause I'm all alone
All alone

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kylie Minogue]
We are dreaming
About Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
Dreaming
About Lhuna
Her and me
Simultaneously

Her and me
Effortlessly
Oh, her and me
Effortlessly





[Verse 1]
There's a wild wind blowing down the corner of my street
Every night there, the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming on the radio, I heard
Baby, it's a violent world

[Chorus]
Love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming, I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Verse 2]
Time came a-creeping and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on, time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night

[Chorus]
Love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Outro]
Gravity, release me and don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground


[Verse 1]
There's an old song coming on the radio
Overrun they got us, let the garbage grow
Tell the kids stop feeling for the refugees
'Cause they're not like you and they're not like me

[Chorus]
All of the boys they rock and roll
Cause they don't wanna talk anymore
All of the girls get no say in the world
Just dismissed, kiss their kids off to war
The lobby lines, the diamond mines
Don't listen to the people who won
It's a beautiful, beautiful world

[Verse 2]
There's a new song coming on the radio
Frutas florecen en todo el mundo
Let the flowers all blossom
The hummingbirds hum
We're all born equal under the same sun
Someone could be you and you could be someone
So do to each other as you would be done

[Chorus]
All of the boys they rock and roll
Cause they don't have to hate anymore
All of the girls, they're all over the world
The sound of the four-to-the-floor
And everyone is part of the sum
Riches will rain on the poor
Say oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa
It's a beautiful, beautiful world


You take the noise or you make the noise
So sing it like never before
Say oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-waoh
It's a beautiful, beautiful world
Beautiful, beautiful world



[Verse]
Now I never meant
To do you wrong
That's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong
Then I'm sorry
Don't let it stand in our way
Cause my head just aches
When I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for living
We all know
And I don't want to live it alone
Sing
Ah, ah, oh
Sing
Ah, ah, oh
And just sing
Ah, ah, oh


She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar
Lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight
To share this moonlight

She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

She knows what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses
Sugar kisses
Just when you think she's yours
She's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break
To melt into this lake


She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

She'll be my mirror
Reflect what I am
A loser and a winner
The King of Siam
And my Siamese twin
She knows what I'm thinking

She'll flow down your river
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses



[Verse 1]
Maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows
Cause I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

[Chorus 1]
Maybe I just want to fly
I want to live, I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

[Verse 2]
I said maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows
Cause I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

[Chorus 2]
Maybe I will never be
All the things that I want to be
But now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

[Verse 1]
Maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows
Cause I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain

Maybe I just want to fly
I want to live, I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breathe
Maybe I just don't believe

We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever




[Verse 1]
Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across
Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

[Chorus]
I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

[Verse 2]
You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
Cause along may come
A bigger one

And you'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting till the firing stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve
No better or no worse

[Chorus]
I just got lost
Every river that I've tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Verse 2]
You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won, 'cause along may come
A bigger one

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
With the same sword they knight you
They gon' good-night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus, see success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you're ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you have to be Bobby now
And the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all? Because I'm-

Falling, falling 'till I'm in
Until I started tearing in

Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even right is wrong

[Chorus]
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we are gonna get out

Ooo, ooooo

Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Ohh ohh...
Dreaming of when the morning comes

Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now

Reign of Love

[Intro]
(One, two, three)

[Verse 1]
Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locust wind
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love

[Verse 2]
Locust wind
Here I stop
How I wish I'd spoken up
To a reign of love

[Verse 3]
Reign of love
By the church we're waiting
Reign of love
On my knees go praying
How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried on a reign of love

[Verse 1]
You see the world in black and white
No color or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the seas
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any color I can see

[Hook]
All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or up as us
As us

[Verse 2]
You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try


[Hook]
All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or up as us

[Bridge]
And don't you wanna see it come soon
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given on your own silver spoon
Don't you wanna see it come down
There for throwing your arms around
And say "you're not a moment too soon"

[Outro]
Cause I feel low
Cause I feel low
Oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah I feel low
Oh no, oh
Oh cause I feel low
Cause I feel Low
Oh oh oh oh oh
But I feel low
Oh no, oh


[Verse 1]
Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you

[Chorus]
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
Oooh ooh ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, such a precious jewel

[Chorus]
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you


[Bridge]
Wanna fall, fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it ma-, ma-ma-magic
Oooh ooh ooh-ooh
Oooh ooh ooh-ooh
Oooh ooh ooh-ooh
Oooh ooh ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Of course, I do



[Verse 1]
Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic here with all of you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic when I'm next to you
Eoh-eoh

[Chorus]
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
And I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Verse 2]
Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, you're such a precious jewel

[Chorus]
No, I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
I don't, no I don't, no I don't, no I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

[Bridge]
Wanna fall, fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic, call it true
Call it ma-magic

[Verse 3]
And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Well, yes, I do
Of course I do

[Verse 1]
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do
And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

[Hook]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

[Verse 2]
They got one eye watching you
And one eye on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true
No, don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world

[Hook]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

[Bridge]
You could hear them climbing the stairs
Got my right side fighting while my left hides under the chairs

[Hook]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

[Intro]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the darkness before the dawn
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 1]
In the darkness before the dawn
In the swirling of the storm
In the swirling of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches and hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 2]
Millions of miles from home
In the swirling swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

In the darkness
Before the dawn
In the swirling
Of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches
And hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Millions of miles from home
In the swirling
Swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on

[Verse 1]
From up above I heard
The angels sing to me these words
And sometimes, in your eyes
I see the beauty in the world

[Chorus]
Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and she lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
Eyes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the stars decide
To reflect in puddles in the dirt
When I look in your eyes
I forget all about what hurts

[Chorus]
Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
And cry

(Believe in miracles)

[Outro]
Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now
Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
My father said never give up son
Just look how good Cassius become
Muhammad, Mahatma, and Nelson
Not scared to be strong

[Spoken]
"What if they say I'm no good? What if they say "Get out of here, kid. You got no future?"

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Now you could run and just say they're right
No, I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say, "No, wait, they're wrong"
And get to keep on dancing all life long

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Oh Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Now you could run and just say they're right
No I'll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait, they're wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I'm trying to turn k's to m', what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Outro: Chris Martin]
In you I see someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong





[Verse 1]
Come on now, don't you want to see
This thing that's happening to me
Like Moses has power over sea
So you've got a power over me

Come on now, don't you want to know
That you're a refuge, somewhere I can go
And you're air that, air that I can breathe
You're my golden opportunity

[Hook]
And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish

[Verse 2]
Come on now, don't you want to see
Just what a difference you've made to me
I'll be waiting no matter what you say
And I'll keep waiting for days and days and days

[Hook]
I wish

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
If the sky's gonna fall down let it fall on me
If you're gonna break down you can break on me
If the sky's gonna fall down let it fall on me
Oh Lord, let it fall on me


[Verse 1]
Somewhere up above the stars
The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown, a government is overthrown
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last

[Chorus]
And I heard it on the radio that one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a TV show that somewhere up above and in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars
We won't see the earth again
And the seconds just remain unchanged

[Verse 2]
8 to 9, 9 to 10
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again, you and me
We are meeting for the first time can't you see
7 6 5 4 3
We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony

[Shortened Chorus]
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars
Past the satellites and stars, they're moving us to Mars



[Hook]
Murder coming to get us
Yeah coming to get us and away we hide
Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And away we hide
Murder coming to get us
They're coming to get us
And away we hide
Away we hide

[Verse 1]
Tie me to a tree
Tie my hands above my head
Sing a song to me
Sing a song like what you said

[Chorus]
And they're going to murder me
They're going to take me down
Even before I sleep
I cry murder

[Verse 2]
Come spit at us
Come and throw your weight around
Come and fight with us
Try and knock us to the ground

[Chorus]
'Cause they're gonna murder me
They're going to take me down
Even before I sleep
I scream murder
Murder

[Bridge]
Oh now, what can it possibly gain?
Oh, what can it possibly gain?
Oh now, what can it possibly gain?
Oh yeah, what can it possibly gain?
Cry murder, murder
I cry murder

[Hook]
Murder I'm coming to get us
I'm coming to get us
And away we hide
Murder, see it all around us
See it all around us
And away we hide
Murder coming to get us
It's coming to get us
And away we hide
Murder, see it all around you
See it all around you
And away we hide

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me
But I wake up
Yes I wake up smiling

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
So I wake up
Yes I wake up smiling

[Pre-Chorus]
So what? I feel fine
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll go, and I'll try to stop moving

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep
But I've got to get going, so much that I'm wanting to do
But I wake up smiling

[Chorus]
And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
No more keeping my feet on the ground


[Verse 4]
Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
And I move
I wake up smiling

[Pre-Chorus]
So what? I feel fine
I feel OK, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll go, well it's time to stop moving

[Chorus]
And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
So no more keeping my feet on the ground

[Outro]
I'm not gonna keep on
I'm not gonna keep on the
I'm not gonna keep on
I'm not gonna keep on the ground

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me baby where did I go wrong?
I went to the doctor guess what she told me
Guess what she told me
She said boy you better try to have fun
No matter what you do
But she's a fool
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Let me go, boys, let me go
Push my boat from the highest cliff to the sea below
Rocks are waiting, boys, rocks await
Swoop down from the sky and catch me like a bird of prey

Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Singing now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Verse 1]
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

[Verse 2]
And I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

[Verse 3]
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned and rise
Following 'em up

[Verse 4]
Still, I always look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know, they're gone
They fly on
Fly on
Oh ohhhh

[Bridge]
So fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on

Wait for your call, love
The call never came
Ready to fall up
Ready to claim
I'm ready for it all, love
Ready for the pain
Meet under sun and
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
The rain

[Verse 2]
Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for the change
Meet me in blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain
The rain, the rain
The rain, the rain

[Outro]
Got to find yourself alone in this world
To find yourself alone


[Instrumental]

Wait for your call, love

In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
The rain
Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for a change
Meet under blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain
The rain, the rain

The rain
Got to find yourself alone in this world
You've got to find yourself alone

Here's an Ode, ah, to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It keeps me through the day
Another ode, ah to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It's the confidence I need

[Chorus]
It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

[Verse 2]
Here's an Ode, an ode to aerosol
It's my thing
Ah, it's my favourite hygiene, it's the confidence I need

It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

It's okay, oh, would I ever let you down, no way
Oh, would I ever let you down, okay?
Oh, would I ever let you down, no way
Oh, would I ever let you down
I'll never let you, I'll never let you, I'll never let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way




Flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
It's how you think of love

And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

Flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned
And rise following them up

Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
They fly on

Oh, so fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on, ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you
Fly on

[Verse]
Tony was a friend of mine
We were together all the time
He had my back
Once he really saved my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna call him
Say, "Hey, let's stay up 'til morning"

[Chorus]
And when I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
I see you, you
When I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
You come through, you
Time just deepens
Sweetens and mends
Old friends

[Outro]
We all melt back into the picture
Raindrops back into the water
Old friends
Hmm, hmm
And there are no ends to old friends
Amen


A flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love
And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on
A flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned
And rise following them up
Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on
So fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
They fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I come fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on

Could you, could you come on?
Could you come on together
Put your knees on the back
To my love in the weather

And the sugar teeth that I crawl in the surface, oh
I was underneath and I'm caught in the middle of
Gonna crawl my way and I climb home because

[Verse 1]
The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
It's old and it's old and it's old
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated
Oh no

[Chorus]
What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things from which you can't escape"

[Verse 2]
Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others
Oh no

[Chorus]
What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, "It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things which you cannot explain"

[Verse 3]
And it's making me cry love
And it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away love
And I'm slipping away

[Outro]
It's only superstition, only your imagination
It's only superstition, only superstition




O
Don't ever let go

Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon

[Refrain: Chris Martin & Choir]

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends

Back and be young again

Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune

[Refrain: Chris Martin & Choir]
But he went (Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tulips the colour of honey today
(It's true, true, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
He say

Back and be young again (Yeah)

Come sailing us home by the light of the moon

Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again

I guess we'll be raised on our own then
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh

I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

[Chris Martin & Choir, Moses Martin]
I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon
She went, woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Indigo up in heaven today
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka


[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune
He went, woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Tulips the colour of honey today
It's true true, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
He say

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Choir]
Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again
Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka


[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

[Chorus]
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

[Verse 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

[Chorus]
And dream of para-para-paradise

Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves
Of my heart
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Oooooooh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

[Verse 2: Rihanna / Rihanna & Chris Martin]
Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game
And why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

[Post-Chorus: Chris Martin & Rihanna]
And stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves
Of my heart
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Oooooooh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

[Verse 2: Rihanna / Rihanna & Chris Martin]
Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game
And why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame


[Chorus: Rihanna]
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

[Post-Corus: Chirs Martin & Rihanna]
And stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 1]
So I waited for you
What wouldn't I do?
And I'm covered, it's true
I'm covered in you
If I ever want proof
I find it in you
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

[Chorus]
Light and dark
A bright spark
Light and dark
And then, light

[Verse 2]
So I waited all day
What wouldn't I say?
And are there things in your way?
Things happen that way
Oh
And if I ever want proof
Then I find it in you
Oh
Yeah I honestly do
In you I find proof

Light and dark
A bright spark

Prospekt's March

Smoke is rising from the houses
People burying their dead
I ask somebody what the time is
But time doesn't matter to them yet

People talking without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Prospekt, how could I forget?

Drums, here it comes
Don't you wish that life can be as simple
As fish swimming round in a barrel?
When you've got the gun
Oh when I run, here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get to any kind of control
But I wasn't one

Now here I lie on my own in a separate sky
Here I lie on my own in a separate sky
I don't wanna die on my own here tonight
But here I lie on my own in a separate sky


Poppyfields

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and green
NIght is the bride of a lonely day
Time was just floating on
Then there was rain
This sound foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a pyramid tumbling
Time just floated away
We can watch it and stay and we can listen

[Chorus]
Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

[Verse 2]
Then there was rain
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart, well it broke again
Time so vicious
Singing, the deeper that the knife goes in the more you win
You end up with less than where you begin
The deeper that the knife goes in
Ooooooh

[Chorus]
Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

[Outro]
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house (x2)


1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm


So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed

She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again


I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

(Raspberry beret)
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second hand store)
Oh no no

(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)

I think I... I think I... I think I love her

(Raspberry beret)
No no no
No no no (The kind you find)
(In a second hand store)
(Raspberry beret)

Tell me
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she)
(Wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)
I think I love...

Game of what now?

I'm a rastafarian, Targaryen
I got some dragons and they're
Very scary and
Been here and there and then I've
Been everywhere again
Rastafarian, Targa...
Call me Daenerys Targaryen
When you wanna reach me
And if you feel the love
Then you can call me Khaleesi
Got so many names
I'm Queen of the Andals
Queen of the Meereen
Yeah ! You can kiss m' sandals

[Intro]
You don't mess around with Walder Frey...
(Don't mess around with)
You don't mess around with Walder Frey...

[Verse 1]
If you're here for the wedding of Robby Stark
Keep the car running, there's no need to park
He's not going to make it, through the night...
Keep that wedding cake in the fridge
He didn't pay me back for using the bridge
I'm afraid this wedding won't be white...

Boom, boom, boom, babba dippi dum
Boom, boom, boom, babba dippi bum

[Verse 2]
Red wedding, red wedding
Lots of stabbing and a bit of beheading
The Rains of Castamere are here to stay...
Red wedding, dead wedding
A head, shredding, bloodshed wedding
There will be no wedding bedding, hey
You don't mess around with Walder Frey!



[Instrumental]


Oh, Love is a burning thing
And it makes a firey ring
Found my wild desire
I sleep into a ring of fire
I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
Oh, I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went hgher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
Oh, The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire was wild
Oh, I feel into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burnin ring of fire
I went down down down
And the flames went higher
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
The ring of fire...



All winter, we got carried
Away over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer, we just hurried
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry

But you never even see me



[Verse 1]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?

But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I'll change for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say-

[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

[Verse 2]
So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?

But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care, if you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I'll change for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say-

[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
For you I will always be waiting

[Final Chorus]
And it's you I see, but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you

[Outro]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me


Been going since 1996, for me 2006
Still dropping some sick beats
You talked about bein' yellow thought I'd join you with a little bit of hard metal
Talked about a paradise, you helped me find mine, still ballin'
You asked me if I wanted to be something like this
Not spiderman no superman you taught me to be me
You taught me how to be a king without a crown, now I got the keys
You taught me to sing maybe without having wings
LIke Michael Jordan or some Scotty Pippins
You showed me to an adventure
I can now sing at the end of the weekend
You got me anywhere home or away, kinda like Triple-A
You showed me the keys to the
P-A-R-A-D-I-S-E!



[Verse 1]
Climb up your mountain
Nineteen and counting
You have got seven
I have got one
Blinded and hurting
This I'm deserving
I've got my secrets
You've only got the Sleeping Sun

[Verse 2]
When you've got a secret
Then you've got to keep it
When you have a question
Answers will come
Running and hiding
Taking dividing
You've got your secrets
I've only got the Sleeping Sun

[Chorus]
The Sleeping Sun
Singing
Oooh um
Ohhhh oh
Ahhh ahh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

[Verse 3]
And you as I saw
Were a piece in a jigsaw
Run up the divide and
Tip of the tongue
Run round the houses
North and the south is
You've got your answers
We have both got the Sleeping Sun

[Chorus]
The Sleeping Sun
Singing
Oooh um
Ohhhh oh
Ahhh ahh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh


If you see me sliding
Say we're gonna slide together

If you see me hiding
Tell me I can hide forever

Come
With me now
As now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

When my clouds are crying
Say you're gonna change my weather

If you hear me lying
It's never when we lie together

Come
With me now
As now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

If you see me sliding
Pray that I won't slide forever


If you see me hiding
Say that we can hide together

Come
With me now
Cos now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

Come
With me now
Cos now I run
Show me how to be someone
Let me fly into your sun

Your sun (x16)

Oh, when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you

Oh, I once was lost and now I'm found
I'm gonna do what I should do
And when I get back on my feet again
I'm gonna run my way to you

Oh, when all is lost and come undone
I'm gonna sing out, and see ya through
But no, the water
The water flows over

Oh, when I get back off my feet again
I'm gonna crown my days a turn

So all I've been on my knees again
And I'll do it all the time

And when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you

Oh, I once was lost, but now I'm found
So here's what I'm gonna do

I sing, oh, the water
The water flows over
I sing, oh, the water
The water flows over you



[Verse 1]
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control, and Batman with his fists
Now clearly, I don't see myself upon that list

[Pre-Chorus]
But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts

Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass u every day
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way...

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized
No, staring at his picture I realized
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending
And all good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last

All good things that say, never last
And love, it isn't love until it's past


Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She's a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
I never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kind of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone

[Verse 1]
Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one you know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I say, oh
I say, oh

[Verse 2]
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh yeah I will, yeah I will, yes I will, yeah I will

[Chorus]
I said, oh
I cry, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out


[Outro]
La, la, la, la, oh...
La, la, la, la, oh...
La, la, la, la, oh...
La, la, la, la, oh...



[Verse 1]
Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one you know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I say, oh
I say, oh

[Verse 2]
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I will, yes I will

[Chorus]
I said, oh
I cry, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, oh...
La, la, la, la, oh...
La, la, la, la, oh...
La, la, la, la, oh...


[Verse 1]
How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

[Verse 2]
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

[Hook]
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand


[Verse 3]
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

[Hook]
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

Ah when you see it then you'll understand

[Bridge]
All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent

[Hook]
Birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand



They built a web for me
They spun a web for me


[Verse 1]
I can't maintain a relationship
They remind me I don't relate to shit
I love you, I'm not in love with you
But I want you in my life and that's an issue
I hate to say I'm not committed, I admit it
Only 22, I'm tryn' live it to the limit
You know I'm coming back for you the minute that I'm finished
Right now, a girlfriend would be a blemish on my image
I led you on and you might think I'm selfish
But I like your company, I really can't help it
Even though I see you twice a week
Tell me why you adamently fight for me
Saying please don't leave, but I'm focused on my plan
It's not personal, I hope you understand
Some day, you will trust me again
But for now, I'm sorry that our love had to end

[Verse 2]
I had a fallin' out with a family member
I lashed out and said some shit I still can't remember
For a while, I was actually crazy
But, I wouldn't change the past if you paid me
You live and you learn, you slip and you burn
Work hard and keep your mind off the figures you earn
I'm highly aware what the fame could bring
I won't ever let money fuck up a good thing
It once did, but that saga's over
And if anything it brought us closer, now we always sober
A buncha guys on the rise
Realize we gon' ride 'til we die with our eyes on the prize
Look, instead of falling over like some dominos
We put our egos to the side for one common goal
And fuck the politics, we'll handle it together
Friends come and go, man family is forever


[Verse 3]
I thought I had support from my family
Until my mom said don't forget about a plan B
I don't blame her, she doesn't understand me
I love making music, I don't need to win a grammy
You can be the best at what you do
But it doesn't matter, cause it means nothing 'til you're paid
I rather stay poor doing something that I love
Than to ever be rich doing something that I hate
I can truly say that I'm happy with my life
I'm never let down cause my attitude is right
It's undeniable, my passion on the mic
These other rappers do it for the glamour and the lights
But I'm different, and I never been more certain
Nobody is perfect but we all serve a purpose
So fall back, while I pull away the curtains
And let my light shine, I know it's the right time

[Verse 1]
I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, "How do you live as a fugitive
Down here, where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know?
Show me the right way to go"

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

[Verse 2]
I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives - look at the way we live
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear, no
I said, "Which way do I turn?"
Oh, I forget everything I learn

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies


[Bridge]
And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us
And if we don't hide now
They're gonna catch us where we sleep
Ah, and if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so good 'cause you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
They can't touch you, no
'Cause they're just spies

[Outro]
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies



[Verse 1]
I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, "How do you live as a fugitive
Down here, where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know?
Show me the right way to go"

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so good 'cause you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
Well they can't touch you, no
'Causes they're just spies
They're all spies

[Verse 2]
I awake to see no one is free
Well we're all fugitives - look at the way we live
Down here, where we cannot sleep from fear
I said, "Which way to turn?"
Oh, I forget everything I learn

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so good 'cause you know
With those spies hide out in every corner
Well they can't touch you, no
'Cause they're all spies

[Bridge]
And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us
And if we don't hide now
They're gonna catch us where we sleep
And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us

[Outro]
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies


I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, "How do you live as a fugitive
Down here where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know
Show me the right way to go"

And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here I cannot sleep from fear no
I said, "Which way do I turn?"
Oh I forget everything I learn

And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies



[Verse 1]
You're in control, is there anywhere you wanna go?
You're in control, is there anything you wanna know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're travelling

[Hook]
From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want...
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

[Verse 2]
Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top I can't get back
Whoah, woah

[Hook]
First line of the first page
To the end of the last day
You were looking
From the start in your own way
You just want...
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

[Bridge]
Oooh
You just want somebody listening to what you say
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

[Outro]
Is there anybody out there who is lost and hurt and lonely too?
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
And if you come undone as if you'd been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Well, if you're stuck in square one


Still going strong (He's still going strong)
Yeah, yeah (He's still going strong)
Remember Ned Stark, he was a lot of fun. (So fun)
But he didn't make it past Season One (Oh no)
Robert Baratheon was part of that crew
But he never made it to Season Two
The King of the North was cool, you said (So cool)
Another favorite that ended up dead (He's dead)
You thought that Joffrey had to survive
He ain't in the credits for Season Five (Season Five)
Baby, you know I'm the man for all seasons
Characters get cut for various reasons (Ow ow)
Some people's parts just ain't that long
But not me (Not me, not me, not me)
I'm still going strong (He's still going strong)

[Intro]
They were sitting
They were sitting on the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious

They were sitting
They were talking on the strawberry swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing

Cold, cold water
Bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water
What ya say?

[Chorus]
When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

[Verse]
I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing


People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away

[Chorus]
When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day

[Instrumental Bridge]
Ah

[Outro]
Now the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

Well the sky could be blue
Could be grey
Without you I'm just miles away

Well, the sky could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time

[Cassette tapes changing]

Silver road of only sin
But I'm coming back, don't win
And the streets that rode the morning in

Light that boat on this river
Gotta know where to begin
Come on out, the other soul of Stephen
And things will never be the same again



[Intro]
Such a rush to do nothing at all
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush to do nothing at all

[Chorus 1]
Such a rush to get nowhere at all
Such a fuss to do nothing at all
Such a rush

[Chorus 2]
And it's just like you said
It's just like you said

[Chorus 1]
Such a rush to do nothing at all
Such a fuss to get nowhere at all
Such a rush, such a rush

[Chorus 2]
And it's just like you said
It's just like you said

[Verse 1]
So slow down please
Just slow down
So slow down please
Just slow down

[Chorus 3]
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush

[Verse 2]
Look at all the people
Going after money
Far too many people
Looking for their money
Everybody's out there
Trying to get money
Why can't you just tell me?
Trying to get money, rush

[Bridge]
Such a rush
We all rush
Such a rush

[Chorus 3]
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush
Such a rush

Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said "All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them"
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind


[Verse 1]
You cut me down a tree
And brought it back to me
And that's what made me see
Where I was going wrong
You put me on a shelf
And kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself
You can only blame me

[Chorus 1]
And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost, and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea

[Verse 2]
You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And darling, that's when I
Decided to go see
You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see


[Chorus 2]
And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost, and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ah)
(Ooh, ah)

[Chorus 3]
And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
The streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

[Breakdown]
Oh, what good is it to live
With nothing left to give?
Forget, but not forgive
Not loving all you see
All the streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea


[Outro]
You belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
Yeah, you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea



Come on Marianne
The sun sets in your eyes
I'm in love again
Come on once or twice

Wanna be your air?
Come on now, all I see
Wanna ride along
Follow all our dreams

Kaleidoscopes that fall into the sun
Gonna lay the blame on me, not anyone
Gonna write a song
Sing it to the sun
Don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone

Oh, sweet Marianne
You're the only one I've ever loved
And I swear it on
Swear it on the moon and stars above
I wanna understand
And, I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man
Swear it on the moon and stars

I will full moon
Just a part of me
Gonna write a song and see how a woman feel
Come on get it on right into the sun
Gonna ride along and fly, gonna let it on

Oh, sweet Marianne
You're the only one I've ever loved
And I swear it on
Swear it on the moon and stars above
In my head, you're the only one I've ever loved
I wanna be your man
You're the only one I've ever loved

Oh, don't you love me
Oh, don't you love me
Don't you love me
Oh, don't you love me

Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh yeah




[Verse 1]
Oh, brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you
'Cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

[Chorus]
You could take a picture of something you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done

[Verse 2]
Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

[Chorus]
So, you take a picture of something you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done
Do
Something that's never been done

[Outro]
So, you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's really making any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk, let's talk




[Loop]
So you don't know where you're going

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

[Chorus]
You can take a picture of something you see
Or swim a river out to the sea
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And they're talking it to me
And they're talking it to me
And they're talking it to me
And they're talking it to me

[Chorus]
You can take a picture of something you see
Or swim a river out to the sea
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

[Bridge]
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk?
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored?
When you worry about the future and the 3rd world war
When you worry about the future and the 3rd world war




Then I Take A Picture Of Something You See
You See...
You See...
You See...
You See...
In The Future...
In The Future...
In The Future...
In The Future...
In The Future Where Will I Be?

Oh, Please Talk To Me

Can You Fill The Colors Missing You Need?
Will I Ever Get The Answer I Need?
Oh, Please Talk To Me

Please Talk
To Me


Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been tryin' hard to reach you 'cause I don't know what to do
Oh brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh I wanna talk to you

You could take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where would I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well I feel like they're talkin' in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
And in the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done
Do something that's never been done

So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
But nothing's really makin' any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk



[Verse 1]
Under the great lone star
Try to work out where you are
In the silence of the sea
I don't know where I've been
In the future, in the past
Going nowhere much too fast
When I go there follow me
When I go there follow me

[Chorus]
'Cause i don't know where I'm going but I wanna talk
I feel like I'm going where I've been before
And
I wanna talk

[Verse 2]
Take a picture of
Something that you're not sure of
Bring it back to show me
But I don't know what I see
In the future, find a home
Getting nowhere on your own
Got to find your missing piece

[Chorus Variation]
'Cause you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
And nothing's really making any sense at all
You tell any one who'll listen that you feel ignored
Lets talk
Lets talk
Do you wanna talk?

[Verse 3]
I'm looking upon the floor
I'm trying to sing a song
In a language I don't speak
I try but I can't get through
I'm trying to get to you
But you're difficult to reach

Won't you talk... to....me....

Oooo...

So you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before

Let's talk, let's talk ...
Let's talk, let's talk ...




Computer voice: R-E-M-I-X

Oh, brother I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you
Cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother I can't believe it's true (believe it's true)
I'm so scared about the future
And I wanna talk to you

Computer voice: Now talk baby!
Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

You could take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do something that's never been done

Computer voice: Now talk baby!
Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

Are you lost or incomplete
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece
Tell me how you feel
How you feel
How you feel
How you feel

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung, or do
Something that's never been done

Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...

Computer voice: Now talk baby!

How you feel
How you feel (how you feel)
How you feel...
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk...

So you don't know where you're going but you wanna talk
You'll tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored
When you worry about the future or the third world war
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk...

Computer chant: Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me... Talk to me...




Oh Brother I Can't, I Can't Get Through
I've Been Trying Hard To Reach You 'Cause I Don't Know What To Do
Oh Brother I Can't Believe It's True
I'm So Scared About The Future And I Wanna Talk To You

.....

So You Take A Picture Of Something You See
Or Swim A River After The Sea
You Can Climb A Ladder Up To The Sun
Or Write A Song Nobody Has Sung Or Do
Something That's Never Been Done, Do

So You Don't Know Where You're Going But You Want To Talk
You'll Tell Anyone Who'll Listen But You Feel Ignored
When You Worry About The Future Or The Third World War
And You Feel Like You're Going Where You've Been Before
Let's Talk, Let's Talk

So You Take A Picture Of Something You See
Or Swim A River After The Sea
You Can Climb A Ladder Up To The Sun
Or Write A Song Nobody Has Sung Or Do
Something That's Never Been Done, Do

Let's Talk
Let's Talk
Let's Talk
Let's Talk




[Verse 1]
Under the great North Star
Try to work out where you are
In the silence of the sea
I don't know where I'll be

In the future, in the past
Going nowhere, much too fast
When I go there, go with me
When I go there, go with me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know where I'm going and I wanna talk
I feel like I'm going where I've been before
And I wanna talk

[Verse 2]
Take a picture of
Something that you're not sure of
Bring it back to show to me
But I don't know what I see

In the future, find a home
Getting nowhere on your own
Got to find your missing piece

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
Nothing's really making any sense at all
You tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored
Let's talk, let's talk
Do you wanna talk?

[Bridge]
I'm up in the part of the throne
I'm trying to sing a song
In a language I don't speak

I tried but I can't get through
I'm trying to get to you
But you're difficult to reach
Won't you talk to me?

[Chorus]
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk


[Verse 1]
Oh, brother I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you 'cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

[Chorus]
You can take a picture of something you see
Or swim a river out to the sea
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

[Verse 2]
Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how do you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

[Chorus]
So you take a picture of something you see
Or swim a river out to the sea
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done
Or do something that's never been done


[Outro]
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk?
You tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored?

Nothing's really making any sense at all, let's talk
Let's talk




[Verse]
And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream of making our escape
And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream of making our escape
Oooh...




Sleep on the ocean
Sleep on the sand
I've been very busy since the fall of man
Son of the devil
You won't understand
Now come on, baby
That's a sudden end

Speak of the devil
Inside my head
You've been very busy since the world's gonna end
Tired of the symbol
The sun, the sand
Talk a little louder, I don't understand

Gonna get the supper to the world tonight
I'm gonna fall asleep
There's a tiny little sin I've gotta do
Got to say that I'm only holding up at night
Turn with the flow, or this storm

There's a world outside, wanna let you in
There's a world outside, not going in
The world outside, won't let you in

Love, love got over that storm
Before you get somewhere
Oh, love got over that storm

I've got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride, and I never came back


[Verse 1]
I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the prospector had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold
I went digging for gold
I went down with my brother
A bucket and a shovel
And a book about the color of coal
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold

[Chorus]
There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying what use the metal if the metal don't shine?
She said bring me back a ring because I really want one
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun

[Verse 2]
I went digging for gold
I went down to the valley
Over by the mountain
Where the prospector had been told
I'm marching through the cold
We're marching through the cold


[Chorus]
There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line
Saying what use the metal if the metal don't shine?
She said bring me back a ring cause I really want one
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun [x2]
Again.. One last time
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun

[Verse 1]
And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
Was the hardest part
And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

[Hook]
I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh and I...
I wish that I could work it out

[Verse 2]
And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh
And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh

[Hook]
I can feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're a silver lining the clouds
Oh and I...
Oh and I...
I wonder what it's all about


I wonder what it's all about

[Verse 3]
Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart
Oh and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
I wish that I could work it out

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh

I could feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
Oh, and I
I wonder what it's all about


I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh, and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part

And the hardest part
Was letting go, not taking part
Was the hardest part

And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I

You really broke my heart, oh

And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything

You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're silver lining the cloud
Oh, and I
Oh, and I
I wonder what it's all about


I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

Oh, and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah, that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part

There's a man who swears he's God
But I'm pretty sure he's not
There's a man who walks around
Like he owns the fucking lot

There's a man who takes his time
From the hands of a cuckoo clock
You can hear him walk around
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock

At first, it was easy
But now why's it have to be so hard?
Heaven is a fire escape
You try to cling to in the dark

At first it was simple
But now it got too complicated
But the world just got a lovely time
Or blame it all on my mistake

Maybe I'll find heaven
One day, after dark
Maybe you'll find heaven is a place to part?

Control the way we turn
We are doing everything we can
We still can't seem to switch it on
And oh, my time ran out
I am floating up beneath the clouds
Trying to turn it on, it on


And oh
It's you and me, baby
I'm so sorry
Baby, I've done it, turning me on



[Verse 1]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

[Verse 2]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

[Verse 1]
X and Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
That and this
We're part of a bigger plan
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is

[Verse 2]
You and me
The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea
365 degrees
I am a puzzle, you're the missing piece
Hang on a minute, just a minute, please
I'll come
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

[Chorus 1]
What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Pilots, up and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun


[Verse 3]
X is Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
365 degrees
All of the surface and the underneath
Searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

[Chorus 2]
What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Pilots, up and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

[Outro]
And you don't know that you've been born
Can't see the calm until the storm
Can't tell your right side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're riding on

Can you hear that sound?
I can feel it in me now
Coming from the ground
From my head to my mouth
Oh can you feel it start
Like a bullet in a china shop
Oh when you start don't stop
When it starts you should never stop
No

Oh ten to the dozen
Who does, who doesn't
Who chooses who's chosen
Who must, who musn't
Who rests and who runs out
Don't ask that question
When your world's turned upside down
Oh when your world's turned upside down

I can it feel sink
I said i'd never do that again
Oh can you catch it now?
Oh like a bullet in your mouth
Like a balls and a ball of chain
Spark on another rain
Oh, can you hear that sound?
I can feel it in my mouth
Oh


Oh ten to the dozen
Who does, who doesn't
Who chooses who's chosen
Who must who mustn't
Who rests and who runs out
Don't ask that question
When my world's turned upside down
No when your world's turned upside down

Falling over this side
It feels so wrong it feels right
What it was and what it's not
Come and break it into
Pieces that begin to
What I was and what I'm not



[Verse 1]
How tides control the sea
And what becomes of me
How little things can slip out of your hands
How often people change
No two remain the same
Why things don't always turn out as you plan

[Pre-Chorus]
These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

[Chorus]
(I can't) And I can't decide
(Wrong) All my wrong from right
(Day) Or my day from night
(Dark) Or the dark from light
(I live) But I love this life

[Verse 2]
How infinite is space
And who decides your fate
Why everything will dissolve into sand
How to avoid defeat
Where truth and fiction meet
Why nothing ever turns out as you plan

[Pre-Chorus]
These are things that I don't understand
Yeah, these are things that I don't understand

[Chorus]
(I can't) And I can't decide
(Wrong) All my wrong from right
(Day) Or the day from night
(Dark) Or the dark from light
(I live) But I love this life


[Intro]
(One, two)

[Verse 1]
Steal my heart and hold my tongue
I feel my time, my time has come
"Let me in, unlock the door"
I've never felt this way before

[Bridge]
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

[Verse 2]
Hold my head inside your hands
I need someone who understands
I need someone, someone who hears
For you, I've waited all these years

[Hook]
For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me


[Verse 3]
In your tears and in your blood
In your fire and in your flood
I hear you laugh, I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

[Bridge]
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I've become

[Hook]
For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

One... two...
Steal my heart... and hold my tongue
I feel my time... my time has come
Let me in... unlock the door
I never felt this way before

And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

Hold my head... inside your hands
I need someone... who understands
I need someone... someone who hears
For you I've waited all these years

For you I'd wait... 'til Kingdom Come
Until my day... my day is done
And say you'll come... and set me free

Say you'll come... and set me free
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait... you'll wait for me



One... two...

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa, Anne-Marie & Ellie Goulding]
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away, then follows you back home
And I, I'm a street light shinin'
I'm a wild light blinding bright, burning off alone, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Jess Glynne, Sam Fender, Mabel & Dan Smith]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these we give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Simon Neil, Rita Ora, Mike Kerr & Dermot Kennedy]
I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
I, I am a little divided
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind?

[Chorus: Dan Smith, Rag'n'Bone Man, Mabel, Sigrid, Ellie Goulding & Dave Grohl, Rag'n'Bone Man & Sigrid]
I know
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these, time and time again (Again)

[Verse 3: AJ Tracey, Sean Paul & Celeste]
Let's go, it's times like these that we activate
Do something to improve, don't procrastinate (Oh)
I been cooking now, make a wicked pasta plate
Stream games at 11 but I clap at eight (It's time like these)
And I'll drink on FaceTime if you tempt me
Time to pay back all the health docs lent me (Oh)
And for me West 10's elementary
But right now I wanna see Ladbroke Grove empty, you get me?
We make it better together we'll make a better life
Because the pressure is ever upon us every night
And everyday so we pray and we will forever fight
We'll make it better together, we'll make a better life


[Bridge: Celeste, Paloma Faith, Luke Hemmings & YUNGBLUD]
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away, then follows you back home, mm-mm-hm
I, I'm a street light shining (Ooh)
I'm a wild light blinding bright, burnin' off alone
(Alone, alone, ooh)

[Chorus: All]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
It's times like these you learn to live again

[Outro: Chris Martin]
It's times like these you learn to love again



[Verse 1]
Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

[Verse 2]
Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

[Chorus]
And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

[Verse 3]
Oh no, I see
A spider web, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

[Chorus]
Singing that I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Trouble in town
Because they cut my brother down
Because my sister can't wear her crown
There's trouble, there's trouble in town
Blood on the beat (Oh-oh)
Oh my goodness, there's blood on the beat
Law of the jungle or the law of the street
There's blood on, there's blood on the beat

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I never get released

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Trouble in town (Oh-oh)
Because they hung my Brother Brown
Because their system just keep you down
There's trouble, there's trouble in town

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I just get more police, eh
And I get no comfort
And I get no name
Everything is gettin' strange


[Interlude: Young Men & Police Officer Philip Nace, Chris Martin]
Best friends
What's that?
What's his name?
X (Standby, sir)
Alright, is that X your middle name?
Of course, it's on a vehicle ID, right? (There must be some way)
You gettin' smart? 'Cause you'll be in a fucking car with him
I'm telling you
Fucking smartass (Or it's gonna kick off someday)
I'm asking you what the X is, is that your middle name?
Of course, what is it?
Don't come back with the "What is it?" fucking shit (There must be some way)
Talk to these fucking pigs on the street that way, you ain't talking to me that way
I don't talk to nobody in the streets, I don't hang with nobody
Well, then don't come to fucking Philadelphia, stay in Jersey
I have family out here
Everybody thinks they're a fucking lawyer and they don't know jack shit
Are you supposed to grab me like this?
Grab you up? I'll grab you any way I got to
You're not protecting me by stopping me while I'm trying to go to work
Why don't you shut up?

[Verse 1]
For a second, I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below
Would rise
And I wish you could have let me know
What's really going on below
I've lost you now, you let me go
But one last time

[Chorus]
Tell me you love me
If you don't, then lie
Lie to me

[Verse 2]
Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine

[Chorus]
So tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me
If you don't then lie
Lie to me

Call it true love

[Verse 1]
Sunlight opened up my eyes
To see for the first time, it opened them up
And tonight rivers will run dry
Not for the first time rivers will run

[Verse 2]
Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers looking for life on Earth
Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

[Chorus]
You go backwards but then you go forwards again
You go backwards but then you go

[Verse 3]
Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it, someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to
It belongs to all of us

[Chorus]
You go backwards but then you go forwards again
You go backwards but then you go forwards
You go backwards but then you go forwards again
You go backwards but then you go forwards

[Verse 1]
Lord, I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river going to flow
It just seems that upstream, I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

[Verse 2]
Then that light hits your eye
I know, I swear
We'll find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold
Bullets fly, split the sky
But that's alright, sometimes
Sunlight comes streaming through the holes

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh



[Verse 1]
When I get back on solid ground
Here's what I'm gonna do
Oh, all I've ever lost and found
I'm gonna crawl my way to you

[Verse 2]
When I get back on my feet again
I'm gonna take you to the moon
But you're leaving my hands again
I can wait up there until

[Outro]
Oh, the water
The water flows over
Oh, the water
The water flows over


[Verse 1]
So it's over
This time, I know it's gone
Saltwater
Tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone

[Hook]
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

[Verse 2]
So it's over
This time, you're flying on
This time, I know no song
Can't stop its lonely burn
Can't stop it slowly going

[Hook]
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone


[Hook]
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
Oh, we have slowly gone

[Outro]
Can we pour some water on?



[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Fixing up a car, driving it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it's mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

[Guitar Solo 1: Jonny Buckland]

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow

Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and
We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Spoken Outro]
Our friends, this is the end of A Head Full of Dreams Tour
Back where it all began, Buenos Aires
Thank you, everybody all around the world, at home and abroad
For being the best part of our show, for being the music
And for keeping your and our heads full of dreams
This was our first chapter
From now on, we'll only be full of surprises
We love you, we're grateful for all of you with all of our hearts
We exist for and because of you
Good night, good afternoon, good morning, wherever you are in the world
God bless you all, be kind to each other
We're in this together, we're one big band
Everything is possible if you never give up
And if you believe in love
Believe in, in love

[Verse 1]
The birds they sang
The break of day
Start again, I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away
The birds they sang
All a choir
Start again, a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

[Chorus 1]
The sky is blue
Dreamed that lie 'til it's true
Then taking back the punch I threw
My arms turn wings
Oh, those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then, I'm up with the birds

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Might have to go, where they don't know my name
Float all over the world just to see her again
But I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain


[Chorus 2]
A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way
A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way

[Outro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh, morning come bursting the clouds, amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart, she left a hole
The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

[Chorus]
Sing slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

[Verse 2]
Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight, I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go

[Pre-Chorus]
And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain, saying


[Chorus]
Slow it down
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

[Post-Chorus]
And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain, saying

[Chorus]
Slow it down
Slow it down
Sing slow it down
Sing slow it down

[Outro]
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

[Verse 1]
Oh, morning come bursting the clouds, amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart, she left a hole
The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties
The devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

[Chorus]
And sing
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

[Verse 2]
Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight, I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don't let go
And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain, saying


[Chorus]
Slow it down
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world

[Outro]
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world



[Verse 1]
It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low
If you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And if you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 3]
I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?

[Outro]
I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?




I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sweep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing:
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
(Ohhh)
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter will call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh

[Verse Xxxtentacion]
Love is not kisses, hugs, sharing
Presents on your birthday, pictures of making love
It's dedication, trust and patience and compromise
Now do or die, ultimatums for you and I
I feel the vibe between us fading and I hate it
I cut myself constantly I hate myself for creating
Pain within your heart and I'm thinking
This pistol's tempting to scream it out
To my demons get even within yourself
She's crying she needs your help
And you're selfish think 'bout yourself
All these problems created
Extended from hate with self
And I hope that you wouldn't leave
But the patience that you would need
Is the patience of several gods
Hanging on to my selfish please
And I'm sorry, you deserve better
I wanted more for you, you hanging on
You being strong and I want more for you
As long as you won't, leave me in the end
We both can still pretend
That this life we live in is worth it I promise

[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

A warning sign
I missed the good part then I realized
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

[Chorus]
When the truth is I miss you
Yeah, the truth is that I miss you so

A warning sign
It came back to haunt me and I realized

And you were an island to discover

Lemme be real for a minute
I'm finally ready to admit it
You was my heart but I jetted out
Lemme take a breath so I can spit it out
I miss you, though I've been frontin' like it ain't the truth
It was my way of dealing with it when I skated through
It made it look like I was bitter and I hated you
When really I was tryina save the pain from abandoning roots,
It ain't an easy decision to leave your home
But I was searching for a bigger opportunity to grow
Coz I found where I wanna be, now I just gotta be
Real enough to allow myself to feel some honesty, it was a

[Verse 1]
Wise men say
Looks like rain today
Crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the steepy subway trains
Heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

[Verse 2]
The full moon's bright
Starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something's happened
It's so strange this feeling

Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

[Chorus]
Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says:
"Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?"


[Verse 3]
Wise men say
Looks like rain today
Crackled on the speakers
Trickled down the sleepy subway trains
Heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

[Outro]
We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love, sometimes

Those wedding bells are ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving but I stay still
But I always loved you and I always will

Days of no sleeping
Caked in mud
All kinds of poison in my blood
I lost the only thing I ever loved

Ooh
I heard them ringing and processioning by
Umbrellas in the clear blue sky
I saw you swimming in that sea of white

Ooh
And wedding bells ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving, baby, I stay still
I always loved you and I always will

Ooh
I loved you and I say it still
I always loved you and I always will
Singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la


If everything that went before didn't matter
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I always loved you and I always will

Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love a life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place



[Verse 1]
I wanna live life and never be cruel
I wanna live life and be good to you
And I wanna fly and never come down
And live my life and have friends around

[Chorus]
We never change, do we? no, no
We never learn, do we?

[Verse 2]
So I wanna live in a wooden house
I wanna live life and always be true
I wanna live life and be good to you
And I wanna fly and never come down
And live my life and have friends around

[Chorus]
We never change, do we? No, no
We never learn, do we?

[Verse 3]
So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
Oh, and I don't have a soul to save
Yes, and I sin every single day

[Chorus]
We never change, do we?
We never learn, do we?

[Outro]
So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out


I see trees that are green, red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, ohh what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, saying, "How do you do?"
But they're really saying, "I love you"

I see trees that are green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, oh what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
But they're really saying, "I love you"

I see trees of green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, oh what a wonderful world


I think to myself, ooh what a wonderful world



[Verse 1]
What if there was no light?
Nothing wrong, nothing right?
What if there was no time?
And no reason or rhyme?
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

[Verse 2]
What if I got it wrong?
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

[Hook]
Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?
Oooooh, that's right

[Verse 3]
Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life?
That you don't want me there by your side?

[Hook]
Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Oooooh, that's right

[Outro]
Oh, Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Oooooh, that's right




[Verse 1]
What if there was no light?
Nothing wrong, nothing right?
What if there was no time?
And no reason or rhyme?
What if you should decide

That you don't want me there in your life?

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

[Verse 1 : Chris Martin]
From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one
She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild

[Verse 2 : Kylie Minogue]
When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 : Chris]
On the second day I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I'd seen
I said, "Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?"


[Verse 4 : Kylie]
On the second day he came with a single red rose
Said: "Will you give me your loss and your sorrow"
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed
He said, "If I show you the roses, will you follow?"

[Chorus]

[Verse 5 : Kylie]
On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt (stood smiling) above me with a rock in his fist

[Verse 6 : Chris]
On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
And she lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, "All beauty must die"
And lent down and planted a rose between her teeth

[Chorus]



I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white




[Verse 1]
When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I wanna feel like that
Little white shadows
Blink and miss them
Part of a system, I am

[Verse 2]
If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows
Sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

[Bridge]
All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space, I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up
Ohhhhhhhh

[Hook]
Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state

[Verse 3]
When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you wanna feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system, a plan

[Bridge]
All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up
Whooaaaaaaa

[Hook]
Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state

[Outro]
Swim out on a sea of faces
Tide of the human races
Oh, an answer now is what I need...
See it in a new sun rising
See it break on your horizon
Oh, come on love, stay with me...


When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little white shadows
Blink and miss them
Part of a system I am

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up
Oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state


When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
Don't you want to feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system, a plan

All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up
Oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you keep it
In a permanent state
A permanent state

Swimming on a sea of faces
The tide of the human race, and so
An answer now is what I need
I see it in the new sun rising
I see it break on your horizon, oh
Come on love, stay with me

Wildling
You make my heart sing
You pull your bow string...
And shoot me
Wildling

Wildling, I think I love you
But I wanna know for sure
I want to take you into that cave and kiss you... down there
'Cause I've never done it before!
Yeah!

Wildling...



[Verse 1: Cat Power]
It's been a night
Such a night
Such a long night
Watch myself disappear
Into the wild side
Said good bye to my hard side
Sang, saw a jackal appear

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Every road, that's wrong
Seems like the road, I'm on
Every sign just seems unclear
Won't you come switch me on
Don't know where I've gone
And I, I wish I was here

[Verse 2: Cat Power (Cat Power and Chris Martin)]
In a fight, such a fight
Hell of a fight
I'm not lying, this I swear
(The demons that hide inside
To the wild, why am I tired
How come I'm never there)

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Every road, that's wrong
Seems like the road, I'm on
Every sign just seems unclear
Won't you come switch me on
Don't know where I've gone
And I, I wish I was here

[Instrumental break]

[Outro: Cat Power]
And I, I wish I was here
And I, I wish I was here


[Verse 1]
In a world gone wrong
I shall be strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people
I will not want
My faith is strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people

[Verse 2]
Our world tonight
Get it right
Holding on to the steeple
Our world tonight
I'm off in light
Wonder of the world, power of the people

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
In a world gone wrong
How can I be strong?
Wonder of the world, power of the people

[Verse 2]
In a world of fright
How do I get it right?
Wonder of the world, power of the people

[Chorus]
And our world tonight
Is turn it right
With the strength of an eagle
Our world tonight
I see the light
Wonder of the world, power of the people

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Intro]
(So I race for it)

[Verse 1]
Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart, boom, b-boom, boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Comin' home and I'm finding no peace

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know, and I know
I know I'm unlocked
And I know, and I know, and I know
I know what you've got

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up to the sky, I feel alive
You've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, that's alright
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)

[Verse 2]
Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, b-boom, boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been innocent, but a sinner in me


[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in love
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm lost

[Chorus]
I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
Got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling like
I've got a rocket; eyes on the prize
Put my hands up to the sky
I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
So I race for it (yeah, yeah)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

[Outro]
(So I race for it)
And I know, and I know, and I know
I know what I've got
(So I race for it)
"X" marks the spot
So I put my hands up to the sky, I feel like
I've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
Put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
Put my hands up to the sky, feeling like (yeah, yeah)
I got a rocket; eyes on the prize
Put my hands up to the sky; I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure (yeah, yeah)
Wherever you are

[Verse 1]
Trying hard to speak
And fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
It's all part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Anyway you can

[Verse 2]
I dive in at the deep end
You become my best friend
I wanna love you
But I don't know if I can
I know something is broken
And I'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it
Anyway I can

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing


Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Look how they shine for you

Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

[Verse 1]
When it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool
Of us in the daylight

Then we were dying of frustration
Saying "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it's not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone

[Hook]
If you'd only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows I'm trying my best
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

(Hey!)

[Verse 2]
So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming "Let the windows down!"
As I crawl to the ground


[Hook]
If you'd only if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness

You only live twice
Or so it seems
One life for yourself
And one for your dreams

You drift through the years
And life seems tame
'Til one dream appears
And Love is its name

And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
Or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only live twice

And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
Or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only live twice
